      A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can.
      If unable to flee, it may fight. 

      A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. 

      A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
