   \n    <p>\n      Most of these just do what they do in real life, but some need specific clarification\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"bandages1\">Bandages</h4>\n    <p>\n      Bandages are used to apply <a href=\"#first-aid\">first aid</a>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"backpack1\">Backpack</h4>\n    <p>\n      Without a backpack, a character is limited to just what they can carry in their arms and can wear.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Additionally, a character with a backpack can carry an additional 5 slots of gear due to the improvement in weight distribution. This addition is added in before multipliers, such as due to being a small character.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      However, drawing an item from your backpack is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. As a character's hands are usually accounted for, almost all items in a character's inventory are assumed to be in their backpack.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"bandolier1\">Bandolier</h4>\n    <p>\n      A bandolier goes across the chest and has two pouches. Additionally, a pistol can be holstered on it. A bandolier cannot be worn with medium or heavy armor. Normally, a character can only wear one bandolier.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"bedroll1\">Bedroll</h4>\n    <p>\n      A character who sleeps in the wilderness without a bedroll suffers (see <a href=\"#sleeping-in-the-wilderness\">Sleeping in the Wilderness</a>).\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"belt-pouch1\">Belt Pouch</h4>\n    <p>\n      A belt pouch can carry a small item, a potion or 100coins. You can have two belt pouches without penalty.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"bullseye-lantern1\">Bullseye Lantern</h4>\n    <p>\n      A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"candle1\">Candle</h4>\n    <p>\n      A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"case1\">Case</h4>\n    <p>\n      A map/scroll case is waterproof and reasonably fireproof. Without one, scrolls are 10% chance to be ruined for every round immersed in water and stowed maps/scrolls are 10% to be ruined whenever the character is exposed to fire damage (like a fireball spell).\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"crowbar1\">Crowbar</h4>\n    <p>\n      A crowbar is necessary to open some containers or get the proper grip/leverage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Any useful application of a crowbar adds +2 to the roll.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"hooded-lantern1\">Hooded Lantern</h4>\n    <p>\n      A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"lamp1\">Lamp</h4>\n    <p>\n      A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A lamp in a character's hand is AC 15 and has 1 hit point.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"sack1\">Sack</h4>\n    <p>\n      You can put stuff in a sack. Without a sack, a character can only carry 200 coins. You can fill a large sack with stuff and sling it over your shoulder, but this requires you to hold onto it and there is no weight distribution advantage like with the backpack.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"torch1\">Torch</h4>\n    <p>\n      A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a simple weapon that deals 1d4 fire damage (no strength bonus to damage).\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"weapon-sheath1\">Weapon Sheath</h4>\n    <p>\n      A character can have one one-handed weapon sheathed on their belt or two light weapons. Having more than that gives them penalties.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"holster1\">Holster</h4>\n    <p>\n      A holster is like a weapon sheath but for pistols.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</section>", "Naval Gear Tables": "<section>\n  <h3 id=\"naval-gear-tables1\">Naval Gear Tables</h3>\n  <section>\n    <h4 id=\"naval-gear1\">Naval Gear</h4>\n    <table class=\"equipment\">\n      <thead>\n        <tr class=\"table_header\">\n          <th>Good </th>\n          <th> Cost</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr class=\"odd\">\n          <td><a href=\"#naval-supplies\">Naval supplies</a> </td>\n          <td> 2gp/crew/day</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr class=\"even\">\n          <td><a href=\"#cannonball\">Cannonball</a> </td>\n          <td> 10gp</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  </section>\n</section>", "Naval Gear Descriptions": "<section>\n  <h3 id=\"naval-gear-descriptions1\">Naval Gear Descriptions</h3>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"naval-supplies1\">Naval supplies</h4>\n    <p>\n      Naval supplies include rum rations (grog).\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h4 id=\"cannonball1\">Cannonball</h4>\n    <p>\n      A cannonball includes the powder needed to fire the cannon.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</section>"}

              <p>
                Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of failure, you roll a twenty-sided
                die (d20). To determine if your character succeeds at a task you do this:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <ul>
                <li> Roll a d20.</li>
                <li> Add any relevant modifiers.</li>
                <li> Compare the result to a target number.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds. If the
                result is lower than the target number, you fail.
              </p>
            </div>
            <section>
              <h4 id="dice">Dice</h4>
              <div>
                
                <p>
                  Dice rolls are described with expressions such as “3d4+3,” which means “roll three
                  four-sided dice and add 3” (resulting in a number between 6 and 15). The first number
                  tells you how many dice to roll (adding the results together). The number immediately
                  after the “d” tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that indicates a
                  quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="d">d%</h5>
                <p>
                  Percentile dice work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100
                  by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the
                  tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.
                </p>

              <div>
                
                <p>
                  A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll. A positive modifier is
                  a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In most cases, modifiers to a given check or roll stack (combine for a cumulative
                  effect) if they come from different sources and have different types (or no type
                  at all), but do not stack if they have the same type or come from the same source
                  (such as the same spell cast twice in succession). If the modifiers to a particular
                  roll do not stack, only the best bonus and worst penalty applies. Dodge bonuses and
                  circumstance bonuses however, do stack with one another unless otherwise specified.

                    The bonus or penalty associated with a particular ability score.
                    Ability modifiers apply to die rolls for character actions involving the
                    corresponding abilities.

                  <p>
                    An armor bonus applies to <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> and is granted by armor or by a spell or
                    magical effect that mimics armor. It can also be granted by "natural" armor, like
                    a dragon's scales or a bear's tough hide. "Natural" armor and armor don't stack.

                  <p>
                    A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors
                    impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all
                    other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from
                    essentially the same source.

                  <p>
                    A competence bonus (or penalty) affects a character's performance of a particular
                    task, as in the case of the bardic ability to <a href="#inspire-competence">inspire competence</a>.

                  <p>
                    A deflection bonus affects <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> and is granted by a spell or magic effect
                    that makes attacks veer off harmlessly.

                  <p>
                    A dodge bonus improves <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a> (and sometimes Reflex saves) resulting from
                    physical skill at avoiding blows and other ill effects. Dodge bonuses stack with
                    all other bonuses to AC, even other dodge bonuses.

                  <p>
                    An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness
                    of armor or natural armor, or the effectiveness of a weapon, or a general bonus to
                    an ability score. Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object (in the case of
                    armor and weapons), creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do
                    not stack. Only the highest enhancement bonus applies.

                  <p>
                    A luck modifier represents good (or bad) fortune. Multiple luck bonuses on the same
                    character or object do not stack. Only the highest luck bonus applies.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A morale bonus represents the effects of greater hope, courage, and determination
                    (or hopelessness, cowardice, and despair in the case of a morale penalty).

                  <p>
                    A profane bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of evil. Multiple profane bonuses
                    on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest profane bonus
                    applies.

                  <p>
                    A bonus (or handicap) granted because of the culture a particular creature was

                <p>
                  In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is
                  one-half or larger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Exception: Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.

              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="multiplying">Multiplying</h5>
                <p>
                  Sometimes a rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you’re
                  applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more
                  multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a die roll),
                  however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding
                  1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (×2) and a double
                  (×2) applied to the same number results in a triple (×3, because 2 + 1 = 3).
                </p>
                <p>
                  When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or distance),
                  normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size doubles (thus
                  multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone (which would multiply
                  its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs about 24 times normal, not 10
                  times normal. Similarly, a blinded creature attempting to negotiate difficult
                  terrain would count each square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for
                  a total multiplier of ×4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice).

              <p>
                Each ability, after changes made because of race, has a modifier ranging from
                -5 to +5. Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells shows the modifier for each
                score. It also shows bonus spells, which you’ll need to know about if your
                character is a spellcaster.
              </p>
              <p>
                The modifier is the number you apply to the die roll when your character tries
                to do something related to that ability. You also use the modifier with some
                numbers that aren’t die rolls. A positive modifier is called a bonus, and a
                negative modifier is called a penalty.

                The ability that governs spells depends on what type of spellcaster your

                ability score, a spellcaster must be of high enough class level to be able to cast
                spells of a given spell level.

                    Wisdom describes a character’s willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition.
                    While Intelligence represents one’s ability to analyze information, Wisdom
                    represents being in tune with and aware of one’s surroundings. Wisdom is the most
                    important ability for <a href="#cleric">clerics</a> and <a href="#druid">druids</a>, and it is also important for
                    <a href="#ranger">rangers</a>. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a
                    high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.

                    Charisma measures a character’s force of personality, persuasiveness, personal
                    magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents
                    actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a
                    social setting. Charisma is most important for <a href="#sorcerer">sorcerers</a> and
                    <a href="#bard">bards</a>. It is also important for <a href="#cleric">clerics</a>, since it affects their ability to

                Hit points represents a character's ability to withstand damage before they die.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character with positive hit points suffers no penalties and can act normally.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character with 0 hit points is staggered and cannot take strenuous actions without falling unconscious. In combat, they can either take move actions or take 1 damage to take a standard action.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character at negative hit points is unconscious and dying. There is a 10% chance they stabilize each round, otherwise they lose 1 hp. A stabilized character is still unconscious but doesn't lose hit points each round.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character who reaches -10 or lower is dead.

                A creature's armor class is the number needed to hit that creature with an attack roll. It is often modified by armor, the character's dexterity, circumstances such as being prone and other effects.

              A difficulty class is a target number for a saving throw or skill check. If the saving throw or skill check is equal to or greater than this number, the roller succeeds.

              <p>
                When creating a new character, ability scores can be determined either by rolling,
                using an array, or using a hybrid method

              <p>
                To roll your ability scores, roll four six-sided dice and discard the die with the
                lowest value. Total the three remaining dice. This number is your strength score.
              </p>
              <p>
                Repeat this process for the other five abilities (dexterity, constitution,
                intelligence, wisdom, charisma).

                If you are boring, you can assign the following six numbers as you choose to the
                six abilities: 14, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12.

              </p>
              <p>
                For the remaining ability scores, roll 4d6, discarding the lowest die.

                As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
                A Dwarf's base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).

                Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.

              <p>
                Dwarves automatically notice new stonework construction. Additionally, the dwarf's chance to notice unusual stonework such as sliding walls, stonework traps, unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, sloping floors is improved by 2 pips on the d6 compared to ordinary characters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dwarves can also intuit depth underground and can approximate how deep underground they are as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.

                Due to the near lethality of dwarven alcohol, Dwarves receive a +2 bonus to saving throws against poison.

              <p>

              <p>
                Loxodons are medium creatures, but they are on the large side of medium. In combat, they can occupy one or two spaces (their choice from round to round). Additionally, they get a +4 bonus to overrun and bull rush checks and strength checks where mass would be of aid (like forcing open or holding a door).
              </p>
              <p>
                A loxodon's base speed is 30 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loxodons are on average 8' tall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loxodons are too large and heavy to ride horses and similar sized mounts. However, when travelling long distances they count as mounted for the purposes of determing overland travel rates.

              <p>
                Loxodons have great memory, able to recall exact events or spoken words when they need to (although they may not remember they need to remember until reminded). Due to this, they have no native writing system in the loxodon language and do not generally pick up how to read other languages. Loxodons start play with no ability to read or write.  A loxodon may spend 2 skill points after the 1st level to learn to read and write the languages they speak.
              </p>
              <p>
                The exception to this is loxodon wizards. They are not illiterate.

              <p>
                A loxodon's nose is just like an elephant's and so can be used to hold or grab things. It can be used to hold one handed items, draw items from their inventory, etc. It cannot be used to effectively wield weapons or shields. Switching an item between the trunk and a hand is a free action.

              <p>
                Suddenly viewing rodents (mice, rats, rodents of unusual size, etc.) can induce a panicked reaction in a loxodon. The loxodon must make a DC 10 will save or be <a href="#panicked">panicked</a> for 1d10 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if the loxodon succeeds on the save or the viewing is not sudden (the loxodon knows there will be rats when entering the room for example), the loxodon suffers a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks while the rodents are in sight or can be heard.

              <p>
                A multiclass character is a character that is more than once class at once. These classes are denoted by the '/' separating the class names, for example the Fighter/Wizard or the Cleric/Wizard/Thief.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the purposes of choosing feats, the character can choose from either of the classes's feat list. For all spells, effects, requirements, etc. they count as a member of both of their classes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A multiclass character requires more experience points to level up than a non-multiclass character. This multiplier is equal to the number of classes they are multiclassing. For example, a Fighter/Wizard requires twice as many experience points to level up as a Fighter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike other games, only certain multiclass combinations are allowed and the math for these combinations are precomputed. Thus each multiclass combination is presented as its own class entry (although it makes copious reference to the normal classes).

                Barbarians land speed is increased by 10'. This benefit is lost if wearing heavy armor or encumbered.

              <p>
                Unlike other characters, barbarians do not know how to read or write the languages they can speak. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points after the 1st level to learn to read and write the languages they speak.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="rage">Rage</h4>
              <p>
                A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per long rest. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to <a href="#strenght-str">Strength</a>, a +4 bonus to <a href="#constitution-con">Constitution</a>, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to <a href="#armor-class">Armor Class</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s <a href="#hit-points">hit points</a> by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.)
              </p>
              <p>
                While raging, a barbarian cannot use any <a href="#charisma-cha">Charisma</a>-, <a href="#dexterity-dex">Dexterity</a>-, or <a href="#intelligence-int">Intelligence</a>-based skills (except for <a href="#escape-artist">Escape Artist</a> and <a href="#ride">Ride</a>), or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function.  He can use any feat he has.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter. A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per long rest. At 4th level and at 8th level, he can use it one additional time per long rest. A barbarian regains use of his rages after restfully sleeping for 8 hours at night.
              </p>
              <p>
                Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his turn, not in response to someone else’s action.

              <p>
                At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="aggressive">Aggressive</h4>
              <p>
                At 3rd level, the barbarian no longer suffers a -2 penalty to AC when charging.

              <p>
                At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked by thieves and can no longer be sneak attacked. This defense denies a thief the ability to sneak attack the barbarian flanking him and also denies him the bonus to attack by flanking.
              </p>

              <p>
                At 6th level, the barbarian gains SR equal to his level.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4 id="damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h4>
              <p>
                At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from any source (including magic and energy attacks). Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. This damage reduction stacks with all other forms of damage reduction.

            <div>
              <h4 id="bard-spells">Bard Spells</h4>
              <p>
                A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard’s Charisma modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music).
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level before long resting. His base daily spell allotment is given in his table.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bard’s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon reaching any level, a bard may choose to learn a new spell in exchange for a spell he already knows.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="bardic-knowledge">Bardic Knowledge</h4>
              <p>
                A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the bard may make a DC 20 bardic knowledge check for any unidentified magic item. Upon a successful roll, the item is identified.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="hide-in-shadows">Hide In Shadows</h4>
              <p>
                At 2nd level, the bard is able to blend into shadows and darkness to make himself nearly invisible. This functions similarily to the thief ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bard may not do this once combat has begun. Any amount of shadowy lighting is sufficient to allow the bard to attempt to hide in the shadows.
              </p>
              <p>
                While hiding in shadows, the bard gains the benefits of invisibility (he is not literally invisible, but if no one sees you, you effectively are). This ends if he draws attention to himself, attacks, casts a spell, sings a song, etc. Although he may not hide while in combat, a bard will often begin combat hidden in the shadows. The bard may move about while hiding in shadows, as long as he remains within some amount of shadow or natural obscurement.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the bard's hiding is tested, the bard rolls a hide check contested by the opposing creature's spot check. A creature must be within 20 feet of the bard to be eligible to roll a spot check.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="bardic-music">Bardic Music</h4>
              <p>
                Once per long rest per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired).
              </p>
              <p>
                While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance, as long as there is a sonic component to the performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even while using bardic music that doesn’t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands), or command word.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="countersong">Countersong</h4>
              <p>
                Standard action to start, but not to maintain. Max 10 rounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components).
              </p>
              <p>
                Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic attack or a language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if it is greater.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic attack or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save.
              </p>
              <p>
                Countersong does nothing against effects that don’t allow saves.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="fascinate">Fascinate</h4>
              <p>
                Standard action to start, standard action each round (but cannot be used in combat). Max 10 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working.
              </p>
              <p>
                For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for the Will save against the effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.

            <div>
              <h4 id="inspire-courage">Inspire Courage</h4>
              <p>
                Standard action to start, must use voice each round to maintain (thus cannot cast bard spells). Maximum of 5 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter.
              </p>
              <p>
                An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 4th and 8th level, this bonus increases by 1. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="inspire-competence">Inspire Competence</h4>
              <p>
                Standard action, maximum of 2 minutes, must play each round.
                A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard’s music.
              </p>
              <p>
                Certain uses of this ability are infeasible (such as stealth).
              </p>
              <p>
                A bard can’t inspire competence in himself.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="suggestion">Suggestion</h4>
              <p>
                A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using this ability does not break the bard’s concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                Making a suggestion doesn’t count against a bard’s daily limit on bardic music performances.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Will saving throw (DC the bard's performance check) negates the effect. This ability affects all fascinated creatures.

              <p>
                A cleric’s alignment must be within one step of his deity’s (that is, it may be one
                step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both).
                A cleric may not be neutral on an axis unless his deity’s alignment is also neutral
                on that axis.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, a lawful good cleric of a lawful neutral god is allowed.
                A chaotic netural cleric of a chaotic evil god is not allowed.

                A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura
                corresponding to the deity’s alignment.

              <h4 id="deity">Deity</h4>
              <p>
                A cleric must worship a deity. A cleric does not necessarily need to be a member of
                the organized religion of that deity, but that would be unusual.
              </p>
              <p>
                A cleric chooses two domains from his deity's domains, which grant him a special
                ability and access to a bonus spell in his domain slot (see spells below).

              <p>
                A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However,
                his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or
                ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must
                choose and prepare his spells in advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at
                least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric’s
                spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric’s Wisdom modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each
                spell level per long rest. His base spell allotment is given in his table. A cleric
                also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level.
                When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his
                two domains.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell
                on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must
                choose which spells to prepare during his meditation. A cleric can change their prepared
                spell slots each morning during their prayer, but they only recover expended spells
                when they rest for a long time.

              <p>
                A cleric can spontaneously convert any of his spells into one of his domain spells. He
                loses that prepared spell and instead casts a domain spell of the corresponding level.
                This does not make the cleric a spontaneous caster.

                  Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by
                  channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All clerics can turn undead (for evil clerics it is fear of a more powerful source
                  rather than of goodness). Powerful Good and neutral clerics destroy undead, while
                  powerful evil clerics instead command the undead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per long rest equal to 3 + his
                  Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +1
                  bonus on turning checks against undead.

                  Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard
                  action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="range">Range</h5>
                <p>
                  You turn the closest turnable undead first, and you can’t turn undead that are more
                  than 60 feet away or that have total cover relative to you. You don’t need line of
                  sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="turning-check">Turning Check</h5>
                <p>
                  The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature
                  you can turn. Roll a d6-3 and add the result to your level. This is the Hit Dice of
                  the most powerful undead you can affect.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="turning-damage">Turning Damage</h5>
                <p>
                  If your turning check is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead
                  within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for turning
                  damage. That’s how many total Hit Dice of undead you can turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do
                  not waste your turning capacity on them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They
                  flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack
                  rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however,
                  they overcome being turned and act normally. (You can stand within 10 feet without
                  breaking the turning effect—you just can’t approach them.) You can attack them with
                  ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any
                  fashion, without breaking the turning effect.

                <p>
                  If you have twice as many levels (or more) as the undead have Hit Dice, you destroy
                  any that you would normally turn.

                <p>
                  Evil clerics command undead instead of destroying them. Whenever an undead creature
                  would be destroyed by an evil cleric, instead they are fall under his control.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A commanded undead creature is under the mental control of the evil cleric.
                  The cleric must take a standard action to give mental orders to a commanded undead.
                  At any one time, the cleric may command any number of undead whose total Hit Dice do
                  not exceed his level. He may voluntarily relinquish command on any commanded undead
                  creature or creatures in order to command new ones.

Use these abilities a total number of times per long rest equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This granted power is a supernatural ability.

              <p>
                Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, cutlass, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones. Druids get +1 AC when using a wooden shield.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

                <p>
                  A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s Wisdom modifier.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per long rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her meditation. She can change her prepared spells during her daily meditation, but does not recover any until she rests for a long time.
                </p>

                <h5 id="spontaneous-wild-shape">Spontaneous Wild Shape</h5>
                <p>
                  A druid can channel stored spell energy into wild shape spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any wild shape spell of the same level or lower.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>

                <p>
                  A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

              <p>
                A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.
              </p>
              <p>
                Druidic has its own alphabet.

              </p>
              <p>
                A druid can spend points in the scent skill, although she can only use it when
                wildshaped into an appropriate creature.

            <div>
              <h4 id="wild-empathy">Wild Empathy</h4>
              <p>
                A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.
              </p>
              <p>
                The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

                Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

              <p>
                Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

                Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, and sling.
                These are referred to as monk weapons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields
              </p>
              <p>
                When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities. He may wear normal clothing or robes.

              <p>
                When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC. In addition, the monk gains a bonus to AC as given in his table.

              <p>
                When making an unarmed attack or attack with a melee monk weapon, the monk may make an extra attack with the same weapon.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="greater-flurry-of-blows">Greater Flurry of Blows</h4>
              <p>
                At 8th level, a monk gets another extra attack from flurry of blows.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="unarmed-strike">Unarmed Strike</h4>
              <p>
                Monks are considered armed even when unarmed, sufferring none of the usual drawbacks of fighting unarmed. A monk's unarmed attacks can deal either lethal or nonlethal damage with every hit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Monks also deal increased damage. The damage is given in their monk class table.

            <div>
              <h4 id="fast-movement1">Fast Movement</h4>
              <p>
                An unarmored monk gains a bonus to their land speed as given in their class table.

            <div>
              <h4 id="stunt-points">Stunt Points</h4>
              <p>
                Monks have stunt points they can use to do cool stuff. Look at the table to see how many you get.
              </p>
              <p>
                These stunt points are regained when you long rest.

            <div>
              <h4 id="stunning-fist">Stunning Fist</h4>
              <p>
                At 1st level, you learn how to stunning fist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stunning fist costs 1 stunt point.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must declare that you are using this before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt).
              </p>
              <p>
                Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + ½ your character level + your Wis modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally.
              </p>
              <p>
                A defender who fails this saving throw is stunned for 1 round (until just before your next action).
              </p>
              <p>
                A stunned creature drops everything held, can’t take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, can be sneak attacked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some creatures are immune to stun.

            <div>
              <h4 id="deflect-arrows">Deflect Arrows</h4>
              <p>
                At 2nd level, a monk can deflect arrows and bullets.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged weapon (including firearms!), you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must be aware of the attack and able to respond.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="bonus-feat">Bonus Feat</h4>
              <p>
                At 6th level, monk can take a bonus monk feat.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="evasion">Evasion</h4>
              <p>
                At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, the monk instead takes no damage.
                Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing no armor.
                A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.
              </p>
            </div>

              <h4 id="still-mind">Still Mind</h4>
              <p>
                At 3rd level, the monk gains a +2 bonus to saves against all mind-affecting effects, like charms, dominations, sleep spells, etc.

                  The ranger is able to follow tracks.
                  To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful Survival check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.

                <p>
                  You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on Table: Track DC.

              <h4 id="wild-empathy1">Wild Empathy</h4>
              <p>
                A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.

              <h4 id="favored-terrain">Favored Terrain</h4>
              <p>
                At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of terrain to be his favored terrain (given below).
                The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Hide, Move Silently, Search, Listen, Spot, and Survival skill checks while operating in his favored terrain. These benefits only apply outdoors - if you enter a dungeon the benefits no longer apply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, when the ranger builds a shelter in the wilderness (see <a href="#survival">Survival</a>), the level of the shelter is upgraded by 1 level. The ranger can build level 3 shelters even in wilderness in hostile territories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, when travelling long distances through his favored terrain, the ranger and a number of creatures up to (his level + 2)*2 move at twice the normal speed for that terrain if traveling off road. This speed may not exceed the speed of open terrain.
              </p>
              <p>
                At 3rd and 7th level, the ranger may select an additional favored terrain.
                In addition, the bonus against any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.
              </p>

                If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of terrain, the ranger’s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

              <h4 id="animal-companion">Animal Companion</h4>
              <p>
                A ranger may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.
              </p>
              <p>
                A 1st-level ranger’s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a ranger advances in level, the animal’s power increases as shown on the table. If a ranger releases her companion from service, he may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

              <h4 id="combat-style">Combat Style</h4>
              <p>
                A ranger is selected as having one of <a href="#dual-wield-fighting">Dual Wield Fighting</a>, <a href="#pirate-fighting">Pirate Fighting</a> or <a href="#musketeering">Musketeering</a> fighter feats. Hey must choose one at level 1, but can change during a period of <a href="#downtime">downtime</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                He loses these benefits when wearing medium or heavy armor.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="hide-in-shadows1">Hide In Shadows</h4>
              <p>
                At 3rd level, the ranger is able to blend into shadows and darkness to make himself nearly invisible. This functions similarily to the thief ability. He cannot use it while wearing medium or heavy armor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ranger may not do this once combat has begun. Any amount of shadowy lighting is sufficient to allow the ranger to attempt to hide in the shadows. Additionally, the ranger may use the natural environment of his favored terrain to hide in the shadows. For the forest, this would be in the canopy of trees or behind bushes, for the jungle behind ferns or other vines, etc. The natural environment must provide some amount of concealment.
              </p>
              <p>
                While hiding in shadows, the ranger gains the benefits of invisibility (he is not literally invisible, but if no one sees you, you effectively are). This ends if he draws attention to himself, attacks, casts a spell, etc. Although he may not hide while in combat, a ranger will often begin combat hidden in the shadows. The ranger may move about while hiding in shadows, as long as he remains within some amount of shadow or natural obscurement.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the ranger's hiding is tested, the ranger rolls a hide check contested by the opposing creature's spot check. A creature must be within 20 feet of the ranger to be eligible to roll a spot check.

              </p>
              <p>
                He loses these benefits if he wears medium or heavy armor.

            <div>
              <h4 id="evasion1">Evasion</h4>
              <p>
                At 8th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

              <p>
                Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons as well as the musket and blunderbuss.
                They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield.
                Sorcerers cannot cast spells while wearing armor or shields.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="spells2">Spells</h4>
              <p>
                A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer’s Charisma modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per long rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                A sorcerer’s selection of spells is limited. A sorcerer knows spells according the their table. These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can’t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.
              </p>
              <p>
                At every level, a sorcer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows.
                In effect, the sorcerer "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell’s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per long rest for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he’ll cast.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="familiar">Familiar</h4>
              <p>
                A sorcerer can obtain a familiar any time during play (he cannot start play with one). Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that is a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sorcerer can seek out a particular kind of familiar, or see what is most responsive to his personality.
                As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the familiar dies, the sorcerer must roll against <a href="#system-shock">System Shock</a>. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

                  silent, not merely quiet. Additionally, a thief has advantage on
                  such attempts to be silent.

                  The thief can see normally as long as there is any amount of

                <p>
                  Thieves automatically find small traps, such as those upon chests,
                  altars, and such.  This does not find pit traps, floor traps, etc.
                  In general a trap upon an object will be found automatically if
                  the thief declares he is searching for traps upon it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A thief who has discovered a trap with his trapfinding ability
                  can roll to remove the trap. His chance of success is 25% + 5%
                  per level of experience. If he fails, he does not know how to
                  disarm it, but does know how the trap is triggered.

                <p>
                  A thief can hide when unobscured as long he is in hiding in a
                  shadow or shadowy lighting. He can only attempt this when
                  unobserved. A thief who succeeds on this check is effectively
                  invisible as long as he remains in shadow and until the end of his
                  turn in which he leaves the shadows. He is still observable by
                  sound.  This effect ends after the thief attacks, casts a spell,
                  or similar action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The thief rolls for success upon the first time they might be
                  discovered. His chance of success is 70% + 5% per level of
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A thief is visible to other thieves (although they still must be
                  noticed via normal means if they would be hidden normally).

                <p>
                  A thief can scale nearly vertical surfaces (such as cliffs,
                  exterior walls, dungeon walls, etc.). They need two free hands to
                  do so as well as their tools (thus a naked thief cannot do so).
                  They can do so without risk of falling by moving at half their
                  normal speed (dashing is impossible while moving at this rate).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If they wish to move faster, they have a 1/6th chance of falling,
                  checked for every 100' of vertical distance (checked at least
                  once).

                <p>
                  A thief through smooth fast-talking can implant a suggestion in
                  the subject's mind. The thief influences the actions of the
                  target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a
                  sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner
                  as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to
                  do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The thief's chance of success is 60% + 5% per level of
                  experience. If it succeeds, the target must make a wisdom saving
                  throw or follow the course of the suggestion. If the thief's
                  roll fails, he cannot attempt to con the same target again for
                  24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This ability cannot function in combat.

              <p>
                A thief who manages to sneak behind a character or monster and
                reach them while completely unnoticed may make a special attack on
                the target. The target must not be in combat or similarly engaged
                (as a character in combat is constantly moving).  The thief has
                advantage on this attack and if it is successful it deals double
                damage. This attack must be with a one-handed melee weapon.  The
                multiplier increases to x3 at 5th level and x4 at 9th level.

                2nd level thieves can dodge, disengage or dash as a bonus action.
                A thief cannot dash twice in one turn.

              <h4 id="takedown">Takedown</h4>
              <p>
                At 2nd level, thieves are capable of performing a takedown when
                they can backstab.  When successfully performing a backstab, if
                the victim is a humanoid and has fewer hit dice than the thief has
                levels, the thief can choose to make the special attack a
                takedown. He must use a bludgeoning weapon such as a club to do
                this.  If he does, then the victim must make a constitution saving
                throw (DC = damage dealt) or be knocked out for a number of hours
                equal to 1d4 + the thief's level.  If the victim would be reduced
                to 0 hp or less from the backstab, he does not die and instead
                automatically fails the save.
              </p>
              <p>
                A thief who tries to use this ability on a humanoid who has equal
                or greater hit dice than the thief instead performs a regular
                backstab with the bludgeoning weapon.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h4>
              <p>
                At 5th level, thieves can make two attacks instead of one attack
                when they take the attack action. They still only get one attack
                when making a backstab, but if they miss they can try again
                immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                (design question: maybe backstab shouldn't scale but you can
                backstab twice?).

                7th level thieves can nimbly dodge dragon's breath. If they are
                subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw for
                half damage, they instead take no damage if they succeed on the
                throw and only half damage if they fail.

                At 9th level, the thief has attained the status of Master Thief.
                They can use their experience, infamy and reputation to found a
                thieves guild in a suitably populated area. 6d10 thieves will join
                the master thief at his secret guildhall and he will start
                receiving monthly income from guild dues. The DM has more specific
                information.

                Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, pistol, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield.
                Wizards cannot cast spells while wearing armor or shields.

                A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.
                A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).
              </p>
              <p>
                To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level.
                The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard’s Intelligence modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per long rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike other spellcasters, a wizard can only prepare a <b>single copy</b> of a particular spell in between long rests.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells.
              </p>
              <p>
                She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night’s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook.
                While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.
              </p>
              <p>
                A wizard may change her prepared spells at the beginning of each day, but does not recover any.
                She cannot prepare any spell she has cast so far this long rest.
                Spells are only recovered during a long rest.

                  A wizard must study her spellbook each long rest to prepare her spells.
                  She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for <a href="#read-magic">read magic</a>, which all wizards can prepare from memory.
                  A wizard cannot use anyone else's spellbook to prepare her spells.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells plus three 1st-level spells of your choice.

                <h5 id="arcane-magical-writings">Arcane Magical Writings</h5>
                <p>
                  To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the spell.
                  However, each character uses the system in her own way.
                  Another person’s magical writing remains incomprehensible to even the most powerful wizard until she takes time to study and decipher it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell on a scroll), a character must be under the effect of <a href="#read-magic">read magic</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she does not need to decipher it again.
                  Deciphering a magical writing allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its effects (as explained in the spell description).
                </p>

                  <p>
                    Wizards can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods.

                  <p>
                    Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures.
                    Each time a character attains a new wizard level, she gains three spells of her choice to add to her spellbook.
                    The three "free" spells must be of spell levels she can cast.
                    Pick spells from the wizard spell list that the wizard could cast at this new level.
                    If the list of spells at a certain level is exhausted, the DM will invent new spells.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A wizard can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters one on a magic scroll or in another wizard’s spellbook.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No matter what the spell’s source, the wizard must first decipher the magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Next, she must spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, the wizard understands the spell and can copy it into her spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of copying spells from their spellbooks.
                    This fee is usually equal to the spell’s level × 50 gp.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A wizard can research spells she has heard of (aka on the wizard spell list) during <a href="#downtime">downtime</a>.
                    This costs 100gp per spell level and requires a spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A failed check represents failed research and the spell costs are still expended, but it can be tried again after gaining a level in wizard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the wizard succeeds, she still must write it into her spellbook (see that section below).
                    She still must pay the regular material costs for writing a spell into her book.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Researching a spell this way takes 10 days per spell level.

                    A spellbook has one hundred pages.

                    Note that a wizard does have to pay these costs in gold for the spells she gains at each new level.
                    The time is rolled into the time needed to level up.

                <p>
                  A wizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost spellbook. If she already has a particular spell prepared, she can write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page. The process wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as casting it would. If she does not have the spell prepared, she can copy it from a borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Duplicating an existing spellbook costs 100gp per page and 24 hours per spell.

              <p>
                Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, cutlass, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.
              </p>
              <p>
                Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.
              </p>
              <p>
                A druid/wizard cannot cast any wizard spells while wearing armor, but may cast their druid spells.

              <p>
                However, the fighter/druid must still obey the druid's prohibition on wearing metal armor.

                The fighter/druid prepares and casts spells in the same manner a druid does. See the druid for full information. However use the Fighter/Druid spells per long rest table.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fighter/druid must worship a deity, has the same alignment restrictions and picks two domains at 1st level just like a druid.

            <h3 id="buying-skills">Buying Skills</h3>
            <p>
              Each skill point you spend on a skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. You can’t save skill points to spend later. If you buy a skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks with that skill) for each skill point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Characters get a +1 bonus in any skill that is a class skill for them. This counts as an extra rank for any rule or effect that cares about ranks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your maximum actual rank in a skill is your character level + 3.

            <h3 id="skill-points">Skill Points</h3>
            <p>
              Skill points are used to purchase skill ranks. They are usually earned from levelling up and must be spent immediately - they cannot be banked.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="skill-ranks">Skill Ranks</h3>
            <p>
              A character’s number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="ability-modifier1">Ability Modifier</h3>
            <p>
              The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill’s key ability (the ability associated with the skill’s use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="miscellaneous-modifiers">Miscellaneous Modifiers</h3>
            <p>
              Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="using-skills">Using Skills</h3>
            <p>
              A skill check takes into account a character’s training (skill rank), natural talent (ability modifier), luck (the die roll), and circumstances (all other modifiers).
            </p>
            <p>
              To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character’s skill modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the character’s ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that skill’s key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="difficulty-class1">Difficulty Class</h3>
            <p>
              Difficulty Class (or DC) is the number you are treating to meet or beat with your skill check to succeed at your task. The DM sets the DC based on the inherent difficulty of the task and any circumstancial modifiers.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="opposed-checks">Opposed Checks</h3>
            <p>
              An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by comparing the check result to another character’s check result. In an opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these scores are the same, the status quo prevails.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="trying-again">Trying Again</h3>
            <p>
              In general, you can't try a skill check again if you fail until you gain another rank in that skill. Some skills additionally have consequences of failure that must be taken into account. For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task, additional successes are meaningless.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="untrained-skill-checks">Untrained Skill Checks</h3>
            <p>
              Generally, if your character attempts to use a skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The skill modifier doesn’t have a skill rank added in because the character has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the modifier for the skill’s key ability, are applied to the check. Generally, only a basic level of success or basic kind of task can be accomplished untrained.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.

              <p>
                Some situations may make a skill easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.
                The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account exceptional circumstances.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <ul>
                <li> Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.</li>
                <li> Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to use improvised tools or having misleading information.</li>
                <li> Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work that can be subpar.</li>
                <li> Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing work that must be flawless.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                Conditions that affect your character’s ability to perform the skill change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to the skill modifier and a reduction in the check’s DC have the same result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.

            <h3 id="time-and-skill-checks">Time And Skill Checks</h3>
            <p>
              Using a skill might take a round, take no time, or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an event, or are included as part of an action.
            </p>
            <p>
              These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part of movement.

            <h3 id="checks-without-rolls">Checks Without Rolls</h3>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="taking-5">Taking 5</h4>
              <p>
                When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may choose to take 5. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 5. For many routine tasks, taking 5 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 5. In most cases, taking 5 is purely a safety measure — you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the below average roll (a 5). Taking 5 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn’t help.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="taking-20">Taking 20</h4>
              <p>
                The players should almost never explicitly take 20. It is a tool for the DM to figure out if the players should eventually succeed at a task that can be meaningfully retried when there is no time pressure or outside distraction. In such a circumstance, the DM will ask for the player's skill check modifier, add 20 to that number and compare it to the DC, which will tell him if the players will eventually succeed. He will then randomly determine how long it actually took to accomplish the task.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, escaping from tied ropes is an escape artist check. If the player is left alone, unguarded for hours, and his bonus is high enough, he will eventually wriggle free.

                When more than one character tries the same skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may overlap.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="individual-events">Individual Events</h4>
              <p>
                Often, several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails independently. The result of one character’s Climb check does not influence the results of other characters Climb check.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="aid-another">Aid Another</h4>
              <p>
                You can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a +2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions. (You can’t take 5 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character’s help won’t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you can’t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn’t achieve alone.

                Brewing and crafting must take place in a well-stocked alchemical lab (which costs 1000gp to
                establish). Crafting assumes access to a market for materials - if your lab is in a secret base, you
                will need to obtain raw materials such as saltpetre explicitly somehow.

                  During <a href="#downtime">downtime</a>, you can brew potions. Brewing a potion takes sqrt(cost/25) days of time and some amount of
                  gold or unique material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All alchemists know how to brew potions of healing. To brew other potions, they need to learn the
                  formula for it. Formulas can be learned from other alchemists, found written down or
                  reverse-engineered from potions. However, some potions require materials so rare that they are
                  essentially uncraftable from raw materials. Those are not listed here.

                You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value.
              </p>
              <p>
                Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly; failure means you cannot estimate the item’s value.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also study an item to determine whether or not it is magical.  A DC 20 appraisal check will identify an object as magical. (no retry).

                  A character with at least 10 ranks in craft weapon can craft grandmasterwork weapons.
                  This follows the same procedure as crafting a masterwork weapon, but requires an extra 6000gp on top of that and allows two properties to be added. The properties must be different.

              <p>
                Repairing magical weapons requires at least 6 ranks in craft weapon (or more, depending on the weapon) and special materials as determined by the DM.

            <div>
              <h4 id="lying">Lying</h4>
              <p>
                A bluff check is made to convince another creature that you are speaking earnestly. This is usually necessary when the DM knows your character is lying. The DC for a bluff check is the target's wisdom score. The bluff skill is not used on players for this purpose - the DM just has the character lie and the players must decide for themselves whether the character is lying or not based on their knowledge and the character's behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                The DM will assign a penalty or bonus to the bluff difficulty based on how outrageous or simple the lie is.
              </p>
              <p>
                A successful buff check indicates that the target believes you are not lying -- however he might believe you are mistaken if your lie is outrageous or contradicts some knowledge they have.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="induce-reaction">Induce Reaction</h4>
              <p>
                This use of bluff is to get someone to react to something in a particular way. For example, you might pretend to be afraid of a chasing tiger in an effort to get them to react with fear. Or, you can get others to look a certain direction by claiming you see something. This difficulty for this check is the target's wisdom score.
              </p>
              <p>
                A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="feinting-in-combat">Feinting in Combat</h4>
              <p>
                You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target’s wisdom score + base attack bonus as a standard action.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your Bluff check result succeeds, your target is effectively flat-footed against the next melee attack you make against it (granting you a +2 bonus to your attack). This attack must be made on or before your next turn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
              </p>

              <h4 id="delivering-a-secret-message">Delivering a Secret Message</h4>
              <p>
                You can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Listen check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message.

              <p>
                Note that armor check penalties apply to climbing.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can’t move to avoid a blow, so you are effectively flat-footed. You also can’t use a shield while climbing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4 id="movement-in-combat">Movement in Combat</h4>
              <p>
                With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.

                  A single check is made to climb up a climbing surface. Failure by 4 or less indicates that you make no progress. Failure by 5 or more indicates you fall from a random height, see the following table.

              <p>
                If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. You must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.

              <p>
                Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others’ Spot check results. If you don’t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers rolled a 10 on their Spot checks.
              </p>
              <p>
                You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can’t be sure how good the result is.
              </p>
              <p>
                The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you’re attempting to change your appearance.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.
              </p>
              <p>
                Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can apply disguises to other.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need a disguise kit or appropriate materials (makeup, clothing, etc.) to make a disguise.

            <div>
              
              <p>
                Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you’re writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person’s handwriting is needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you’re not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don’t even need to make a check until someone examines the work. The DC for your forgery check is the wisdom score of the person examining it. Alternatively, if they are skilled in Forgery themselves (like an opposing spymaster), they can roll an opposed forgery check.
              </p>
              <p>
                A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase that character’s suspicion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to the result of successfully lying, the receiver might believe the document to be real, but choose to disregard its contents.

              <p>
                A character with at least 3 ranks in heal can recover some of a character’s hit points suffered from a combat or traumatic event (like falling off a ladder).
              </p>
              <p>
                To do so, such a character expends a <a href="#bandages">bandage</a> and heals their heal bonus.
              </p>
              <p>
                The character recovers that many hit points. A character cannot heal more than the damage received during the combat or traumatic event.
              </p>
              <p>
                The above assumes the character is treated within 10 minutes of the event. The amount that may be recovered is halved if longer then this time period. It is halved again after 24 hours and is no longer possible after 48 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only one attempt can be made on the aided character.
              </p>
              <p>
                A character can benefit from first aid a number of times equal to 3 + their con modifier per long rest.

              <p>
                A character with at least 5 ranks in heal can effectively provide long term care to wounded persons.
                Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.

              <p>
                A trained healer can attempt to remove the poison from a poisoned person within 1 minute of the poisoning. Roll a heal check. If the check is higher than the initial poison DC, the poison is removed and any ability damage is undone. If the poison was a save-or-die poison, the victim is recussitated and loses 1d6 hit points instead of dying. If this check fails, a second check may be made against the secondary damage of the poison. This check replaces the victim's fortitude save if it is better.

If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.
              </p>
              <p>
                Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.

              <h4 id="long-jump">Long Jump</h4>
              <p>
                Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.
              </p>
              <p>
                A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).
              </p>
              <p>
                If your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="high-jump">High Jump</h4>
              <p>
                A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a ledge high above or to grasp something overhead. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.
                Requires a 20-foot running start. Without a running start, double the DC.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Quadrupedal creatures don’t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4 id="hop-up">Hop Up</h4>
              <p>
                You can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="jumping-down">Jumping Down</h4>
              <p>
                If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.

                You can react instantly to guide your mount with your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail, you can use only one hand this round because you need to use the other to control your mount.

                You can react instantly to try to take no damage when you fall off a mount—when it is killed or when it falls, for example. If you fail your Ride check, you take 1d6 points of falling damage. This usage does not take an action.

              <p>
                You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount’s Jump modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an action, but is part of the mount’s movement.

              <p>
                You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move action. A successful Ride check increases the mount’s speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points, 4 points, 8 points, and so on).

              <p>
                As a move action, you can attempt to control a light horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check, you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to roll for warhorses or warponies.

              <p>
                You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to one size category larger than yourself as a free action, provided that you still have a move action available that round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. You can’t use fast mount or dismount on a mount more than one size category larger than yourself.

            <h3 id="scent">Scent (Wis, trained only, animal only)</h3>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                Scent is an unusual skill, as normally only animals and monsters can have it.
                Some unusual abilities allow players to purchase ranks in it however.
              </p>
              <p>
                Scent is used to smell things, both now and past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creatures with the scent skill can identify familiar odors just as humans do
                familiar sights.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures.
                Water-breathing creatures that have the scent skill, however, can use it in
                the water easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor
                completely spoils the ability to properly detect, identify or locate creatures.
                Some odors still afford some ability to detect scents, but increase the DC by 10.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="smell-position">Smell Position</h4>
              <p>
                A creature with the scent skill can attempt to locate the position of a creature by
                scent alone. The DC for such a task is usually 10, but it can be 5 for stinky creatures
                (like orcs) or even lower (like for trogs), or higher (like 15 for reptiles). The
                creature must be within 30 feet in relatively still conditions. If downwind, the
                range is 15' and upwind the range is 60'.
              </p>
              <p>
                A successful check indicates the direction of the creature (or creatures). If
                adjacent to the creature, their position is revealed.
              </p>

              <h4 id="smell-tracks">Smell Tracks</h4>
              <p>
                This works like the ranger's <a href="#track">track</a> ability, but the base DC is 10 for a fresh trail. For each hour the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="other-usages">Other Usages</h4>
              <p>
                Scent can be used as you can imagine it could in the real world. The DM will set an appropriate DC.
              </p>

              <p>
                Gnomes who somehow have the scent skill get +2 to scent checks due to their keen nose.

                Swimming in armor of medium or heavier is impossible. If you are wearing medium or heavy armor you immediately start sinking and go underwater. The time to remove armor is doubled in the water.
              </p>
              <p>
                Swimming in light armor is possible, but suffers a -4 penalty immediately. This penalty doubles after 1 minute.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

            <p>
              After a character's ability scores, race and class has been determined, the player may opt to roll for up to two flaws. Before rolling, the player is allowed to ban 1 of the possible options. For every flaw a character has, they can choose an extra feat at first level.
            </p>
            <p>
              A character cannot roll the same flaw twice. There is no way to remove a flaw.

                    A character can only control/manage one of these. He can turn over the institution
                    to an NPC if he desires, which frees him to pick up a different one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, you can recruit a loyal cohort. The cohort is an NPC two levels lower
                    than you. The DM will roll up 3 npcs (or choose from pre-established NPCs), and you
                    can pick one. You can request a broad category of character: Warrior, Rogue,
                    Priest, Mage.

                  <p>
                    After recruitment, the cohort earns experience at half the rate you do if he does
                    not accompany you on adventures. If he does accompany you on adventures, he gets a
                    half-share of the treasure and earns a proportionate amount of XP (which is
                    effectively half as much as you).

                  <p>
                    The loyal cohort will not betray you unless mind controlled or cursed or whatever.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You control the cohort during combat and adventures. The DM will roleplay the cohort
                    if necessary (or you can do it, whatever).

                  You can "dual wield" wands, using both as a single standard action. This expends twice as many charges from each wand.

                  Wands you use are at +1 caster level.

                  When you use a wand that only has 1 charge left, there is a 50% chance that it regains a charge (returning it to 1 charge).

                You can carry your strength score in slots without being encumbered.

              <p>
                See the <a href="#backpack">backpack</a> for an easy way to carry more. Without a backpack, a character is limited to just what they can wear and carry in their arms. Something like a basket enables you to carry more in your arms. The drawback of the backpack is it is slow to retrieve items from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                A <a href="#sack">sack</a> allows a character to carry more than 200 coins. Without a sack, they are limited to 200 coins. You can fill a large sack with stuff and sling it over your shoulder, but this requires you to hold onto it and there is no weight distribution advantage like with the backpack.

                A <a href="#weapon-sheath">weapon sheath</a> allows them to carry a 1-handed weapon on their belt or two light weapons. A <a href="#holster">holster</a> lets them carry a pistol as well. You can have at most two weapons on your belt.
              </p>
              <p>
                A <a href="#belt-pouch">belt pouch</a> allows you to carry small items on your waist. You can have two belt pouches, typically with a potion or scroll or whatever.

              <p>
                A <a href="#bandolier">bandolier</a> goes across the chest and has two pouches. Additionally, a pistol can be holstered on it. A bandolier cannot be worn with medium or heavy armor.

              <p>
                Any attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range.
                However, each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack roll.
                A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments.
                A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.

                <p>
                  A blunderbuss is a firearm. On a roll of natural 1, the weapon is fouled and cannot be fired until unfouled (a process that takes 5 minutes).
                </p>
                <p>
                  When firing at a creature within 30', you can target an additional creature adjacent to your target with the same attack roll. Roll only once and apply to both.

                  A harpoon can be thrown. A harpoon that deals 8 or more damage impales into the victim. If a rope is attached to the harpoon (which gives it a -2 attack penalty due to the awkardness), the victim cannot move beyond the lead of the rope. If the rope is held short by you or others, they can make strength checks to move, which takes half their movement (or all of it on a failure).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The harpoon can be removed, but deals 8 damage on the way out if taken out violently (taking it out gently requires a DC 10 heal check). In the case of the rope, succeeding by 10 or more means the harpoon is violently ripped out. After 3 checks, the harpoon is not coming out.

                  A longspear has reach. You can strike opponents 10 feet away with it, but you can’t use it against an adjacent foe. If you use a ready action to set a longspear against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character.

                  A quarterstaff need not be purchased - any sturdy stick long enough will do.

                <p>
                  A quarterstaff can be used as a double weapon. Treat it as two light weapons if used in such a way.

                  Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack suffers -1 to the roll and -1 damage.

                  A whip deals nonlethal damage.
                  The whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you don’t threaten the area into which you can make an attack.
                  In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can make trip attacks with a whip.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus to disarm.

            <div>
              <h4 id="armor-proficiency">Armor Proficiency</h4>
              <p>
                Characters can only wear armor they are proficient in.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="armorshield-bonus">Armor/Shield Bonus</h4>
              <p>
                Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="maximum-dex-bonus">Maximum Dex Bonus</h4>
              <p>
                This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if a character’s Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="shields2">Shields</h4>
              <p>
                Shields do not affect a character’s maximum Dexterity bonus.
              </p>
            </div>
            <section>
              <h4 id="skill-penalty">Skill Penalty</h4>
              <div>
                
                <p>
                  Any armor heavier than leather hurts a character’s ability to use some skills. An armor's skill penalty is the penalty that applies to Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain kind of armor.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h5 id="shields3">Shields</h5>
                <p>
                  If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both  penalties apply.
                </p>
              </div>
            </section>
            <div>
              <h4 id="drown">Drown</h4>
              <p>
                The drown column indicates whether a character can swim while wearing the armor. This assumes open sea. A value of "Yes" means the character immediately starts sinking and swimming is impossible. A value of "Maybe" indicates a -10 penalty to swim.
              </p>
              <p>
                See the drowning rules for how long you have once you start sinking.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="arcane-spellcasting">Arcane Spellcasting</h4>
              <p>
                Wizards and sorcerers cannot cast spells while wearing any armor. The exception is elven fighter/wizards in elven chain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bards can only cast in light armor.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
              <p>
                The speed column indicates a multipler on your base movement speed. Round up to the nearest 5' increment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Heavy armor reduces your run speed from x4 to x3.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="slots1">Slots</h4>
              <p>
                The slots column indicates the effective bulk of worn armor. Unworn armor encumbers by 5 more slots than this number.

                <h4 id="backpack">Backpack</h4>
                <p>
                  Without a backpack, a character is limited to just what they can carry in their arms and can wear.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, a character with a backpack can carry an additional 5 slots of gear due to the improvement in weight distribution. This addition is added in before multipliers, such as due to being a small character.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, drawing an item from your backpack is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. As a character's hands are usually accounted for, almost all items in a character's inventory are assumed to be in their backpack.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A bandolier goes across the chest and has two pouches. Additionally, a pistol can be holstered on it. A bandolier cannot be worn with medium or heavy armor. Normally, a character can only wear one bandolier.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A character who sleeps in the wilderness without a bedroll suffers (see <a href="#sleeping-in-the-wilderness">Sleeping in the Wilderness</a>).

                <h4 id="belt-pouch">Belt Pouch</h4>
                <p>
                  A belt pouch can carry a small item, a potion or 100coins. You can have two belt pouches without penalty.
                </p>

                <h4 id="bullseye-lantern">Bullseye Lantern</h4>
                <p>
                  A bullseye lantern provides clear illumination in a 60-foot cone and shadowy illumination in a 120-foot cone. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a bullseye lantern in one hand.
                </p>

              <div>
                <h4 id="candle">Candle</h4>
                <p>
                  A candle dimly illuminates a 5-foot radius and burns for 1 hour.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4 id="case">Case</h4>
                <p>
                  A map/scroll case is waterproof and reasonably fireproof. Without one, scrolls are 10% chance to be ruined for every round immersed in water and stowed maps/scrolls are 10% to be ruined whenever the character is exposed to fire damage (like a fireball spell).
                </p>

                <h4 id="crowbar">Crowbar</h4>
                <p>
                  A crowbar is necessary to open some containers or get the proper grip/leverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any useful application of a crowbar adds +2 to the roll.

                <h4 id="hooded-lantern">Hooded Lantern</h4>
                <p>
                  A hooded lantern clearly illuminates a 30-foot radius and provides shadowy illumination in a 60-foot radius. It burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a hooded lantern in one hand.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4 id="lamp">Lamp</h4>
                <p>
                  A lamp clearly illuminates a 15-foot radius, provides shadowy illumination out to a 30-foot radius, and burns for 6 hours on a pint of oil. You can carry a lamp in one hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lamp in a character's hand is AC 15 and has 1 hit point.

              <div>
                <h4 id="sack">Sack</h4>
                <p>
                  You can put stuff in a sack. Without a sack, a character can only carry 200 coins. You can fill a large sack with stuff and sling it over your shoulder, but this requires you to hold onto it and there is no weight distribution advantage like with the backpack.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4 id="torch">Torch</h4>
                <p>
                  A torch burns for 1 hour, clearly illuminating a 20-foot radius and providing shadowy illumination out to a 40-foot radius. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a simple weapon that deals 1d4 fire damage (no strength bonus to damage).
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h4 id="weapon-sheath">Weapon Sheath</h4>
                <p>
                  A character can have one one-handed weapon sheathed on their belt or two light weapons. Having more than that gives them penalties.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h4 id="holster">Holster</h4>
                <p>
                  A holster is like a weapon sheath but for pistols.

                Anything that refers to "per day" or a daily basis is a mistake and should be per long rest.

                Casters who prepare their spells (clerics, druids, wizards) can swap out their unexpended prepared spells for a spell of the same level each day. Wizards need 8 full hours of sleep (4 for elves) and an hour of study. Clerics and druids have to pray at the right time (usually dawn).

              If weather is inclement (rain for example), an unsheltered character suffers the same penalty, which stacks with the above penalty.

              Downtime is a period of rest, training, etc. for an entire season (3 months).

            <p>
              Downtime is usually necessary for crafting, research, training, leveling up, etc.

            <p>
              Downtime activities are measured in days.

              Many downtime activities have an associated gold cost.

            <p>
              This requires a DC 15 + spell level spellcraft check.

                There is a guild for each class (although not for the multiclass combos). For clerics this is their church, for thieves it is a thieves guild, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Players can join or found class guilds as an alternative to founding a domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                They need a good relationship with whoever is in charge, or be an organization that can operate secretly (like the thieves guild). An easy way to accomplish this is for one player character to have a domain and the second one to found a class guild in that domain.
              </p>

                Any creatures outside the grapple can attack creatures in the grapple, but their target is

                damage equal to your unarmed strike (1d3 + strength for a medium creature). You can deal
                either lethal or nonlethal with this damage. Armor spikes add 1d6 to this, but the damage
                must be lethal.

                You can throw your opponent by beating them at a grapple check. They are thrown 5' and
                take your grapple damage.

                If you are larger than your opponent you can do this as a free action and the distance
                is doubled for every size category. (so an ogre would throw you 10').

              <p>
                If you are thrown into a wall or other hard and resisting object, the damage is doubled.

              <p>
                Some monsters (particulary snakes) have a constrict attack. In a grapple they automatically
                deal this damage on their turn unless they are pinned. They don't need to roll for this
                and can also use the deal grapple damage action to deal the damage again.

                round's, or if you have grapple actions then all in one turn). If you don't attempt to complete
                the pin next round, your success is lost.

              </p>
              <p>
                If you fail you are pinned for as long as the opponent chooses to hold you (he has gotten a

            <div>
              
              <p>
                Grab is a special attack that monsters can have (Think a t-rex having you in its teeth).
              </p>
              <p>
                It works somewhat like grappling but differs in a few ways. You will make grapple
                checks/escape artists checks the same way you do in a grapple.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike grappling, the monster usually still threatens other creatures, unless it has you grabbed
                with its only attack form.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature that is two size categories larger than you grabs you when it would instead grapple you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every round you are grabbed, the monster usually does automatic damage to you in some form.
              </p>
              <p>
                On your turn you can try to escape. The monster will have a fixed escape DC in its description.
                You can also try to draw a light weapon and attack the monster back, suffering the same penalties as
                if you were grappling. Depending on the monster, you might be able to use a one-handed weapon in
                addition to light weapons. Some monsters will let you go if you deal enough damage, tentacles might
                be severed, etc. as adjudicated by the DM.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some monsters might try to swallow you when you are in this position - in that case, they need to
                beat you on a grapple check or you get swallowed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most monsters are allowed to fling you as a free action.
                If they are big, they can fling you 10' per size category above medium and you suffer 1d6/10' +str
                damage.
                This damage is doubled if you hit a wall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Spellcasting suffers the same constraints are per grapples - only if it has no somatic components
                and there is a 50% failure chance.

                Some monsters are so big you can't hurt them by stabbing them in their foot.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will often need to climb them to get at their eyes or weakspots or whatever and they can try to
                throw you off.
              </p>
              <p>
                In general you use str + BAB for these checks, but you can use <a href="#climb">climb</a> instead.

              <p>
                You need a weapon designed for tripping. You can also trip as an unarmed attack, but if you are not a monk you get -4 on this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tripping replaces an attack. To trip your enemy, make a strength check adding your BAB, opposed by their strength or dex check adding their BAB. The defender also gets a +4 bonus to this. Every size category larger than medium gives the offender/defender +4 and a similar penalty for being smaller. Some creatures are immune to trip or are exceptionally stable and get a bonus. Bonuses to attack (like bless) apply to this check.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the offender beats the defender's strength check, the defender falls prone in their space.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you trip with a weapon, you can add whatever bonuses you get with that weapon.

              <p>
                Disarming replaces an attack. To disarm your enemy, make an attack roll opposed by their attack roll. Two-handed weapons gives +4, light weapons give -4 and size bonuses are +4 per category different than medium. You get -4 if you disarm unarmed and you are not a monk.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you beat their roll, they are now disarmed. If you were unarmed, it is now in your hands. Otherwise it is on the ground in a random space adjacent to you or them.

            <div>
              
              <p>
                You can overrun as part of your movement. Generally, you need to be bigger than the creature you are trying to overrun. Overrun costs 10' of movement. You must have enough movement to move to the space past theirs. If you cannot go to that space (perhaps it is a wall), you cannot overrun. If there is a creature there, you must overrun them too (see overrunning multiple creatures at once below).
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature can decide to let you through. If he does, then you don't need to spend any extra movement and you must continue to the space past theirs.
              </p>
              <p>
                If they resist, you both make a strength check, adding your BAB and size modifiers.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you fail, your movement ends in your space. If you beat their roll, they are knocked prone and you must continue moving to the space past theirs.
              </p>
              <p>
                In any situation, overrunning a creature does not provoke an attack of opportunity from that creature. It provokes from other creatures as normal for movement.
              </p>
              <p>
                A large creature might try to overrun more than one creature at once. If he does, only one of the creatures rolls the check. He gets +2 on this roll for every other creature that would be overrun. This also applies if you need to overrun more than one creature at once because they are standing one behind the other.

              <p>
                Bullrush replaces an attack. You basically are driving them backwards by pushing them and so must
                spend a consummate amount of movement to both move into their space and then aftewards.
              </p>
              <p>
                You make a strength check, adding bab and size and they make a strength or dexterity check adding
                their bab and size.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you succeed, you push him back 5 feet and 5 more feet for every 5 points you beat his check. He
                does not provoke attacks of opportunity for this movement, but you do as normal.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you fail, youre movement ends and there is no further consequence.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you bull rush them into a wall or similar strong hard surface, they suffer 1d6 damage for every
                5' you would have driven them back. You can add your strength modifier to this damage total.

                Energy resistance is indicated by a numeric quantity. Reduce all instances of the damage source by that amount.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have multiple sources of energy resistance, only the best one applies.

              <h4 id="damage-reduction1">Damage Reduction</h4>
              <p>
                Damage reduction is indicates as DR N/Some damage type. What this means is all bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage is reduced by that amount unless it is of the specified type. For example, skeletons often have DR 5/bludgeoning which means they take 5 less damage from slashing and piercing attacks. If multiple sources of DR would apply, only use the best one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Damage reduction with the special type "-" works a bit differently. It reduces the damage from all damage types, including energy types. Damage reduction N/- stacks with everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                If damage is reduced to 0, that attack does not count as a hit for things that care about that, like poison or a ghoul's paralyzing claws.

            <h3 id="concealment">Concealment</h3>
            <p>
              There are two grades of concealment: partial and total.
            </p>
            <p>
              Partial causes a 20% miss chance and total is 50%.
              Additionally, with total concealment you literally can't see them, so you need to declare what square
              you are attacking and the DM will secretly determine where the enemy actually is.
              This is much like the game of battleship.
              If you miss due to rolling poorly or due to concealment, you don't know if a creature is there or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a creature attacks, casts a spell, etc. it reveals what space it is in. If it then moves, a move silently check opposed by the nearest character's listen check is rolled.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you move into a space with a creature you can't see, they can let you pass through.
              If they don't you can't enter that space but you know where they are.
              If they are of an appopriate size they can temporarily share the space with you, but there is a 50% chance they are discovered.
              On their turn they must leave that space.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a creature has concealment against you, you do not threaten their square.

                A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

              Speed is a tactical speed and is altered by the wind. While travelling farther distances, a ship travels one nautical hex per day.

              Sailors is the number of sailors needed to man the ship.
              A ship can be manned with a skeleton crew (half as many), but goes at half speed.
              Fewer than this number means the ship can't be effectively piloted and floats with the wind.

              <p>
                The sloop is a favored ship of pirates and smugglers. It is 50' long and has 3 decks - the surface, the hold and the bilge.
                It has a single mast.
              </p>
              <p>
                A sloop can have up to 10 guns. 4 on each side, one front and one back.
                The front and back-facing guns are double range and double strength compared to the side guns.
              </p>
              <p>
                A sloop draws a mere 8' of water, making it ideal for shallow waters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maneuvering with a sloop receives a +4 bonus due to its speed and agility.

              <h4 id="brigantine">Brigantine</h4>
              <p>
                The Brigantine is more of a captain's ship for a pirate.
                She has two masts and carry about twice as much as the sloop.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Brigantine can have up to 14 guns. 6 on each side, one front and one back.
                The front and back-facing guns are double range and double strength compared to the side guns.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Brigantine draws 16' of water, meaning it must stay to deeper water than the sloop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maneuvering with a brigantine receives a +2 bonus due to its speed and agility.

              <p>
                The frigate is a warship, most often used to defend convoys.
                The frigate can have 32 cannons, below deck. 2 are mounted in front and 2 in back, with the remaining 14 to each side.

              <p>
                Merchant ships are outfitted to carry cargo rather than men and cannon. They are essentially the same as the sloop, brigantine, frigate, etc.
                They can be refitted into those vessels (convering cargo space into quarters, a gun deck, etc.) for 1/5th of their price.

            <div>
              <h4 id="galleon">Galleon</h4>

                The Galleon is the largest ship and functions as both warship and merchant vessel. They are almost all owned by the Spanish.
              </p>
              <p>
                They pack incredible firepower while still hauling a massive amount of cargo. Beware these ships!

                The subject can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker’s normal speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                A strong wind (21+ mph) can push the subject along or hold it back. At the end of its turn each round, the wind blows the air walker 5 feet for each 5 miles per hour of wind speed. The creature may be subject to additional penalties in exceptionally strong or turbulent winds, such as loss of control over movement or physical damage from being buffeted about.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the creature falls.

              <p>
                You can cast air walk on a specially trained mount so it can be ridden through the air.

                Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature larger than a rat enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm.
              </p>
              <p>
                An alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.
              </p>
              <p>
                In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can intentionally make the alarm spell smaller, in order for it to be more specific. It must be at least 5' in diameter.

              <p>
                You compel a Tiny animal to go to a spot you designate. The most common use for this spell is to get an animal to carry a message to your allies. The animal cannot be one tamed or trained by someone else, including such creatures as familiars and animal companions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using some type of food desirable to the animal as a lure, you call the animal to you. It advances and awaits your bidding. You can mentally impress on the animal a certain place well known to you or an obvious landmark. The directions must be simple, because the animal depends on your knowledge and can’t find a destination on its own. You can attach some small item or note to the messenger. The animal then goes to the designated location and waits there until the duration of the spell expires, whereupon it resumes its normal activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this period of waiting, the messenger allows others to approach it and remove any scroll or token it carries. The intended recipient gains no special ability to communicate with the animal or read any attached message (if it’s written in a language he or she doesn’t know, for example).

              <p>
                You can animate a nonliving ropelike object.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rope obeys your commands for the duration.
              </p>
              <p>
                The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” "move", "strangle" and the opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                If commanded to move, the rope moves at a speed of 30' per round. The rope cannot both move and entangle someone in the same round. Because of this, it is useful to use it as a trap.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rope can enwrap creatures or objects adjacent to it. To do so, the victim must make a reflex save (as if you cast a spell). On a failure, it is <a href="#entangled">entangled</a> in the rope. A creature so entangled can escape with a DC 20 grapple check or a DC 25 <a href="#escape-artist">escape artist</a> check.
              </p>
              <p>
                A rope that is entangling someone can be commanded to tie itself in a knot. If knotted in this way, it is 5 points harder to escape from.
              </p>
              <p>
                A rope that is entangling someone can also be commanded to strangle them. The creature must succeed on a DC 20 grapple check or DC 25 <a href="#escape-artist">escape artist</a> check or suffer 1d6+level damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rope can also be commanded to tie itself into ordinary knots for the purpose of securing climbing surfaces, operating a ship's rigging, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rope can also be commanded into the form of a trip wire if it can mount itself between two points. Any creature who attempts to cross its line must make a reflex save or fall prone.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the spell ends, it does not untie its knots.

                An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.
              </p>
              <p>
                The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%; this roll is made secretly. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <ul>
                <li> Weal (if the action will probably bring good results).</li>
                <li> Woe (for bad results).</li>
                <li> Weal and woe (for both).</li>
                <li> Nothing (for actions that don’t have especially good or bad results).</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                If the spell fails, you get the “nothing” result. A cleric who gets the “nothing” result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury.
              </p>
              <p>
                The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic use the same dice result as the first casting.

                This gives them a +4 armor bonus to AC +1 / 4 levels (so +5 at level 4, +6 at level 8).

                The touched creature constitution score becomes 19. This spell has no effect on those with a  constitution higher than this. Enhancement effects do not enhance this score further.

                Note that the hit points gained from this are not lost first like temporary hit points are - when the spell wears off, the character may find themselves unconscious. This sudden loss of hitpoints can only reduce a character to -5.

                Whenever a player casts a curse, they must devise one of similar power (DM may tweak it).
                It is then permanently added to the table. Beware! Evil clerics will be casting it!

                This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless.
                Only natural animals can be affected by this spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart.

              <p>
                The maximum number of Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level.
              </p>
              <p>
                A dire animal or an animal trained to attack or guard is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not.
              </p>
              <p>
                The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee.
                They are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.

              <p>
                This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.
              </p>
              <p>
                This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as good hope as well as negating a bard’s ability to inspire courage or a barbarian’s rage ability.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also suppresses any fear effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

                You fire a barrage of magic missiles. You fire one missile per two levels. All missiles target 1 creature, striking him for 1d4+1 damage each. Then, one missile disappears and the other missiles move to strike a different creature of your choice. This process repeats until there are no more missiles.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, a 6th level sorcerer casts this spell. He sends 3 missiles at an orc, then 2 at a goblin and then 1 at a kobold.
              </p>
              <p>
                The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

                This spell applies to all natural animals.
              </p>
              <p>
                This charm makes an animal regard you as its trusted friend and ally. Essentially, the creature will join your party.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell does not enable you to control the charmed animal as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do.

              <p>
                An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed animal breaks the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the spell ends, the creature must save again or the spell is permanent. It still ends if you or your apparent allies attack or threaten the charmed subject. A permanent charm animal can be dispelled as any other spell can be. A creature who succeeds on this save may pretend to still be under the sway of it to get its revenge on you. Thus this second save is rolled in secret.

                A caster can only charm up to 1 creature per level of experience.

                Heat metal makes metal extremely warm. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it is holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage if it’s not wearing metal armor and the metal that it’s carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hot metal causes 2d4 points of fire damage to the one in contact (minimum damage is thus 2).
              </p>
              <p>
                Chill metal works the same, but makes the metal painfully cold.

                This spell makes a combustible object or a creature’s combustible equipment burst into flame, even if damp.
              </p>
              <p>
                You deliver this spell as a melee <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attack</a>. When you cast this spell, you can deliver the touch attack as a free action that turn. If you miss, you can try again on subsequent turns or until 10 minutes passes.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the target is a creature, the initial eruption of flame causes 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level with no saving throw.
                Further, the creature must make a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire .
              </p>
              <p>
                If the target is a combustible, unattended object, the initial eruption of flame deals fire damage to the object as noted above.
                The object catches fire and takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round until consumed or someone puts out the fire.

                When cast against an intelligent undead creature, this spell acts like <a href="#charm-person">Charm Person</a>, but for undead.
              </p>
              <p>
                Against unintelligent undead, there is no saving throw and it falls under your command. It can have no more than hit dice than you do. You can control up to your level in mindless undead this way (thus a 5th level wizard could control 5 undead with at most 5 hit dice each).
              </p>
              <p>
                When you control a mindless being, you can communicate only basic commands, such as “come here,” “go there,” “fight,” “stand still,” and so on. Nonintelligent undead won’t resist suicidal or obviously harmful orders.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your commands are not telepathic. The undead creature must be able to hear you.

                You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options, or another similar one you make up.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the subject can’t carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

                When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to understand the spoken words of a creature or read an otherwise incomprehensible written message (such as writing in another language).
              </p>
              <p>
                In either case, the wizard must touch the creature or the writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the ability to read does not necessarily impart understanding of the material, nor does the spell enable the caster to speak or write an unknown language.
              </p>
              <p>
                Written material can be read at the rate of one page or equivalent per round.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magical writing cannot be read, other than to know it is magical, but the spell is often useful when deciphering treasure maps.
              </p>
              <p>
                This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (the level secret page and illusionary script spells), and it does not reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

                This spell has two modes: you can either make fire burn in the area more intensely or less intensely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fire that leaves the area remains affected by the spell. Fire brought into the area is also affected by the spell.

            <div>
              <h4 id="more-intense">More Intense</h4>
              <p>
                All normal fires within the affected area flare up, burning twice as hot and twice as bright.
              </p>
              <p>
                The illumination radii of all nonmagical fires double (so a torch casts bright illumination in a 40-foot radius), and all nonmagical fires deal double damage (so a creature that catches on fire takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round).
              </p>
              <p>
                Fire affected by this spell burns out twice as quickly, so a torch that is the subject of the spell burns out in 30 minutes instead of the normal hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magical fire in the area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, burns hotter, dealing +1 point of fire damage per die.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 id="less-intense">Less Intense</h4>
              <p>
                All normal fires wiithin the affected area flare down, burning half as hot and half as bright.
              </p>
              <p>
                The illumination radii of all nonmagical fires halve (so a torch casts bright illumination in a 10-foot radius), and all nonmagical fires deal half damage (so a creature that catches on fire takes 1d3 points of fire damage per round).
              </p>
              <p>
                Fire affected by this spell burns out half as quickly, so a torch that is the subject of the spell burns out in 2 hours instead of the normal hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magical fire in the area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, burns cooler, dealing -1 point of fire damage per die.

                When you cast this spell, one of your hands is coated with deadly acid.
                A touch attack with this hand causes 1d8 points of acid damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use this melee <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attack</a> up to one time per level.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also deal this damage as extra damage with an unarmed strike or an attack with a natural weapon.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you grapple an opponent, you can deal this damage in addition to other damage you deal via grappling.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you finish casting this spell, you can make a touch attack with that hand as a free action this turn.

                This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large—possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles. Do note how little a gallon is when spread out.

                The target of the spell has a hard time avoiding attacks, sometimes even seeming to stumble into harm’s way. The subject takes a –2 penalty to AC.
              </p>
              <p>
                The curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, removecurse, or wish spell (which would be quite the waste).

                The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell’s range.

              <p>
                Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of this magical light. This spell is the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light.
              </p>
              <p>
                If daylight is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light-proof covering, the spell’s effects are blocked until the covering is removed.

                Daylight brought into an area of magical darkness of a lower level dispels it. If it is equal level, they mutually dispel each other.

                A deep slumber spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 10 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
              </p>
              <p>
                Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the duration ends, the creatures continue sleeping naturally, but may wake up due to normal noise or other normal ways of waking a creature.

              <p>
                This powerful phantasm fools the subject into believing itself more competent and safe than it really is. The spell makes any action the subject considers attempting seem easily accomplished, requiring only a token effort.
              </p>
              <p>
                Deadly wounds seem like mere scratches, stalwart foes appear weak and intimidated, and the subject’s own attacks seem stronger and more effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result of its skewed perceptions, the subject takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to Wisdom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the subject becomes so completely enamored with its own (false) abilities that it cannot fight defensively or take the total defense action.
              </p>
              <p>
                The affected creature must have an ego (so beasts, slimes are not affected, etc.).

              <p>
                You can sense the presence of chaos/evil/good/law (pick only one when you cast it). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                1st Full Round: Presence or absence of evil.
              </p>
              <p>
                2nd Full Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura’s power is overwhelming, and the HD or level of the aura’s source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
              </p>
              <p>
                3rd Full Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

                There are 3 forms of dispel magic. Some spells can't be dispelled - in particular curses. Spell description should describe if it needs a different spell to be dispelled.

              <p>
                In this form, dispel magic affects all creatures and objects in a 30' cube. All spells of 3rd level or lower in the cube immediately end.
              </p>
              <p>
                Animated creatures and summoned creatures can make a will saving throw to ignore this effect.

              <p>
                In this form, the magical properties of a single item, device, ward, etc. is suppressed. Roll a caster level check (d20 + caster level) against a DC set by the DM on a per-item basis. This renders the item non-operational for 1d4 rounds.

                The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location.

                The effect of the potion or alchemical item is doubled. If there is no clear thing to double, the duration is instead doubled. The DM will rule exactly what happens, but for example a potion of healing will heal twice as much.

              <p>
                This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature’s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a -1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.
              </p>
              <p>
                A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target’s speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the spell fails.
              </p>
              <p>
                All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Melee weapons affected by this spell deal more damage (see <a href="#weapon-size">Weapon Size</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Other magical properties are not affected by this spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magical properties of enlarged items are not increased by this spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack,.

              <p>
                The caster enlarges a toad in their hand to become aproximately as large as a person. The toad enters the battle and can act immediately. At the caster's option she may hurl the toad as a grenade-like attack before the magic fully takes effect to a space within 30'.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the toad takes any damage, it instead turns back into a normal toad.
              </p>
              <p>
                The toad has 10 AC and a +2 bonus to saves.
              </p>
              <p>
                The toad will try to grapple an enemy with their tongue each turn.
              </p>
              <p>
                It has a grapple bonus equal to the caster's level +4.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tongue allows it to grapple from a range of 15' away, and, if the initial grapple check is successful, pulls the creature adjacent to the toad.
              </p>
              <p>
                The toad's grapple damage is a mere 1 point of damage.

                Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range.
                If there are natural plants in the area, instead those plants are altered.
                For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Reflex saving throw or be <a href="#entangled">entangled</a> and held fast by the entangling plants until the spell ends. Creatures larger than Large are unaffect (terrain is still difficult).
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check or DC 15 escape artist check. On a success, it frees itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: The effects of the spell may be altered somewhat, based on the nature of the entangling plants.

                You shoot a web at a creature. If you succeed on a ranged <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attack</a>, they are <a href="#entangled">entangled</a> (and anchored to the ground). The creature can escape the web by succeeding on a DC 15 strength check or a DC 20 escape artist check. Fire burns away the webs and deals 2d4 damage to the creature. If they escape the web, the web crumbles away. It otherwise lasts forever.

                This spell enables you and your allies to travel 30' per round faster, but only away from a battle or confrontation. See the rules for <a href="#running-away">running away</a>. In theater of the mind, this spell effectively let's you and your allies get away from a battle, as long as no one is like in a t-rex's jaws or something.

                You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The runes detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the runes (close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the runes is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on which the runes were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).
              </p>
              <p>
                You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the runes. Likewise, you can remove the runes whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with dispel magic.

              </p>
              <p>
                Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.

                The faerie fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

              <p>
                The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature’s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a immediate action, allowing you to cast this spell even when it isn’t your turn.
              </p>
              <p>
                This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

                Fire trap creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A fire trap can ward any object that can be opened and closed.
              </p>
              <p>
                When casting fire trap, you select a point on the object as the spell’s center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell’s center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage +1 point per caster level. The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion. However, it is quite useful to also have a bomb or keg of gunpowder that the firetrap detonates.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fire trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                A knock spell does not bypass a fire trap. An unsuccessful dispel magic spell does not detonate the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use the fire trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.

              <p>
                A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.)
              </p>
              <p>
                If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attack</a>, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.
              </p>
              <p>
                At very far distances (over 100 yards), the DM may require a to-hit roll as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The fireball sets fire to combustibles (papers, parchment, straw, etc.) and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze, greatly diminishing the value of jewelry.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the fireball may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

                This spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage, plus 4d6 points of fire damage.

              <p>
                The caster can fire 1 such bolt for every two levels of experience they have. He rolls a single ranged <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attack</a> and applies the result against all he targets. He must target a different creature with each arrow.

                A burning globe of fire rolls in whichever direction you point and burns those it strikes.
              </p>
              <p>
                It moves 30 feet per round. As part of this movement, it can ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it attempts to enter a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 2d6 points of fire damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates that damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                A flaming sphere rolls over barriers less than 4 feet tall.
              </p>
              <p>
                It ignites flammable substances it touches and illuminates the same area as a torch would.
              </p>
              <p>
                The sphere moves as long as you actively direct it (a move action for you); otherwise, it merely stays at rest and burns.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size.
              </p>
              <p>
                The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame.  It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A Giant could kick it like a soccer ball, suffering 2d6 fire damage in the process and propelling it to where he chooses within 30'.
              </p>
              <p>
                A flaming sphere winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.

                You create a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows you about and carries loads for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 20 slots worth of gear per caster level (or 100 pounds/level for things measured as such).  (If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons.)  Baskets or similar might be needed to ensure excess gear does not fall off the disk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level.
              </p>
              <p>
                It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany you at a rate of no more than your normal speed each round.
              </p>
              <p>
                If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 5 feet between itself and you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk winks out of existence when the spell duration expires.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk also winks out if you move beyond range or try to take the disk more than 3 feet away from the surface beneath it.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also winks out if you cast this spell again.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the disk winks out, whatever it was supporting crashes to the surface beneath it.

              </p>
              <p>
                It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack normally.
                Spellcasting is impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, he immediately plummets to the ground.

                A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can’t use sight to locate the target).
              </p>
              <p>
                A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

                It can’t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in gaseous form (so basically nothing).
              </p>
              <p>
                The subject also loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the gaseous form spell takes effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                A gaseous creature can’t run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet (maneuverability perfect).
              </p>
              <p>
                It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists.
              </p>
              <p>
                The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can’t enter water or other liquid.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form.

                Ghost Harp allows you to record a song into an object. You can then set some trigger that will cause the object to play back the song. It will do so every time the song is triggered, but won't restart if it is already playing. The ghost harp's music itself cannot transmit music (no bardic music abilities).

                Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place.
              </p>
              <p>
                You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound’s basic character.
              </p>
              <p>
                You must create some general kind of sound, like a group of people moaning, talking, singing, shouting walking, marching, running, etc. The nature of the sound is fixed upon casting and cannot react to situations. If you make people talk, attentive listening will reveal it to be gibberish.
              </p>
              <p>
                The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans).
              </p>
              <p>
                The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
              </p>
              <p>
                A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting.
              </p>
              <p>
                A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

                Additionally, the paralyzed subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become <a href="#sickened">sickened</a> (Fortitude negates). A <a href="#neutralize-poison">neutralize poison</a> spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench.

                A grease spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease.
                Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful Reflex save or fall.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature that enters the grease must also make a succesful reflex save or fall, sliding through the grease to the other side and ending their movement there prone (or farther away if they are charging, the grease is on a slide, etc.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Any creature who is standing at the beginning of your turn each round must save again or fall prone in the grease.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell can alternatively be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature allows the creature to make a Reflex saving throw to avoid the effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item.
              </p>
              <p>
                A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the greased item.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature wearing greased armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and on grapple checks made to resist or escape a grapple or to escape a pin.

                Bright lights shine at the targets. The light grants ranged attackers a +2 bonus against those creatures. The light sticks to the creatures and makes it impossible for them to benefit from less than total concealment.

              <p>
                This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4×10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6×10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×10 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Medium creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×5 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                A gust of wind can’t move a creature beyond the limit of its range.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Listen checks in the area of a gust of wind.
              </p>
              <p>
                The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

                Animal creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a warded creature casts a spell near an animal, attempts to turn or command an animal, touches an animal creature, or attacks any creature, the spell ends for all recipients.

                Undead cannot see, hear, or smell the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures.

                Nonintelligent undead creatures are automatically affected and act as though the warded creatures are not there.

              <p>
                An intelligent undead creature gets a single Will saving throw. If it fails, the subject can’t see any of the warded creatures. However, if it has reason to believe unseen opponents are present, it can attempt to find or strike them.

                If a warded creature attempts to turn or command undead, touches an undead creature, or attacks any creature, the spell ends for all recipients.

                This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature without a sense of humor (like a slime) cannot be affected by this spell.

              <p>
                A creature who isn't humaoid receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn’t “translate” well.

                A twisting pattern of subtle, shifting colors weaves through the air, <a href="#fascinated">fascinating</a> creatures within it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Roll 2d4 and add your caster level (maximum 10) to determine the total number of Hit Dice of creatures affected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Affected creatures become fascinated by the pattern of colors. Sightless creatures are not affected.

                This spell does not work in combat.
              </p>
              <p>
                The gestures of the wizard, along with his droning incantation, cause 1d6 creatures within the area to become susceptible to a suggestion--a brief and reasonable-sounding request.
              </p>
              <p>
                The request must be given after the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that time, the success of the spell is unknown.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the caster must speak a language the creature understands for this spell to work).
              </p>
              <p>
                Creatures that successfully roll their saving throws are not under hypnotic influence. Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile save with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is cast at an individual creature that meets the caster's gaze, the saving throw is made with a penalty of -2.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that the caster enspelled it.

                The spell determines all magic properties of a single magic item, including how to activate those functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if any).
              </p>
              <p>
                To identify an item, the caster must handle the item and more or less use it as it is intended (a helmet must be worn, a sword swung, a wand pointed and pseudo activated, a potion sipped, etc.).
                Thus, if the item is cursed, the caster will suffer the consequences.

              <p>
                You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The illusory script appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it’s unintelligible to any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory script.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of the book,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                The casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is always at least 1 minute.

                This spell functions like <a href="#invisibility">invisibility</a>, except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the invisibility ends.

              <p>
                The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle).
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature or casts a spell.

              <p>
                Leaps can be up to 30 feet forward or straight upward or 10 feet backward. Horizontal leaps forward or backward have only a slight arc--about 2 feet per 10 feet of distance traveled. The jump spell does not ensure safety in landing or grasping at the end of the leap.

              <p>
                Upon casting this spell, a very loud "knock" sound can be heard and barriers to entry are undone.
                This noise is certainly loud enough to attract the attention of anyone who happened to be wandering by.
              </p>
              <p>
                The knock spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or arcane locked doors.
              </p>
              <p>
                It opens secret doors, as well as locked or trick-opening boxes or chests.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also loosens welds, shackles, or chains (provided they serve to hold closures shut).
              </p>
              <p>
                If used to open a arcane locked door, the spell does not remove the arcane lock but simply suspends its functioning for 10 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                In all other cases, the door does not relock itself or become stuck again on its own.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knock does not raise barred gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect ropes, vines, and the like.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each spell can undo as many as two means of preventing egress.

                A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character.

              <p>
                Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.

              <p>
                Note that a confused character will not make attacks of opportunity against any creature that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

                Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action.
              </p>
              <p>
                You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to general instability, attacks suffer a -2 penalty while levitating and spells are 20% to be spoiled.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the spell ends, the target plummets to the ground.

                A lightning bolt blasts from your fingertip. You can choose for it either to be a 10' wide, 60' long line (the lightning bolt zigzags to effectively cover that area) or a 5'x wide, 120' long line.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the lightning bolt strikes a hard, non-conductive surface like a wall, the lightning bolt bounces, reflecting according to its angle of attack.
              </p>
              <p>
                A cresture struck by the lightning bolt suffers 1d6 lightning damage per caster level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze (significantly reducing the value of jewelery or art objects).
              </p>
              <p>
                A lightning bolt cast into water spreads out into a globe, affecting a 20' radius sphere.

                By means of this spell, any one item of no more than five pounds weight per level of the spellcaster can be given an aura that is noticed by someone using magic detection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the caster can specify the type of magical aura that is detected (alteration, conjuration, etc.) and this effectively masks the item's actual aura, if any, unless the item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance).
              </p>
              <p>
                If the object bearing this false magical aura has an identify spell cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner has a 50% chance of recognizing that the aura has been placed to mislead the unwary. Otherwise, the aura is believed and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.

If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

              <p>
                This spell imbues the chosen object or creature with an enchanted mouth that suddenly appears and speaks its message the next time a specified event occurs. The message, which must be twenty-five or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class except by external garb.
              </p>
              <p>
                The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.

                Magic weapon gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. This does not stack with weapons that are already enchanted.

              <p>
                The illusion does create sound, smell, texture, or temperature.

              <p>
                The image disappears when struck by an opponent unless you cause the illusion to react appropriately (must be concentrating).

                This spell functions as mage armor, but affects more than one target.
              </p>
              <p>
                An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a mage armor spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike mundane armor, mage armor entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure, or speed reduction.

                Mass shield grants the benefit of shield to all of the targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shield creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you.
              </p>
              <p>
                It negates magic missile attacks directed at you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk also provides a +2 shield bonus to AC against melee attacks and a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks. Note that the shield bonus does not stack with normal shields.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you do not actually hold the shield, it imposes no skill penalty.

              <p>
                You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range.
              </p>
              <p>
                The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn’t transcend language barriers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note: To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing observers the opportunity to read your lips.

              <p>
                Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image.
              </p>
              <p>
                The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets.
              </p>
              <p>
                Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any successful attack against an image destroys it.
              </p>
              <p>
                An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier.
              </p>
              <p>
                Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).
              </p>
              <p>
                While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.
              </p>
              <p>
                An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

                The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a will save.
              </p>
              <p>
                If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.

                A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).
              </p>
              <p>
                A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

                You can open or close  a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container.
              </p>
              <p>
                If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest, or even a particulary heavy stone door), the spell fails.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell’s ability to affect.

              <p>
                Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

              <p>
                Attempts to disarm the "trap" will fail, regardless of the number rolled.

                Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                The effects are minor and have severe limitations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <ul>
                <li> A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material.</li>
                <li> It can color, clean, or dirty items in a 1-foot cube each round.</li>
                <li> It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.</li>
                <li> It cannot deal damage.</li>
                <li> It can affect the concentration of spellcasters, but they are only 10% to be disrupted.</li>
                <li> Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              
              <p>
                The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, a prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to impress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweep dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.

                Flames as bright as a torch appear in your open hand. The flames harm neither you nor your equipment.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to providing illumination, the flames can be hurled or used to touch enemies.
              </p>
              <p>
                When used as a weapon, the flames deal 1d6+1 point per caster level.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flames can either be used for melee <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attacks</a> or as a ranged touch attack with a range of 120'.
              </p>
              <p>
                In either case, each such attack reduces the duration of the spell by 1 minute. As soon as you throw the flame or touch someone with it, a new flame appears in your hand.
                You can use a partial minute for attack and it will deal full damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you cast this spell, you may make an attack with the flames as a free action.

                This spell grants the touched creature and all creatures within the area the benefits of protection from evil (or good, chaos, etc., chosen at casting). The effect moves with the creature targeted by this spell. Creatures who leave the area lose the benefits, but regain it if they re-enter the area.
              </p>
              <p>
                Protection from evil is repeated below.
              </p>
              <p>
                This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures and from mental control.
                It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot.
                The barrier moves with the subject and has two major effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, the subject gains a +2 sacred bonus to AC and a +2 sacred bonus on saves.
                Note this is the bonus of all cleric spells and so does not stack with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm effects and compulsion effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person).
              </p>
              <p>
                The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.
              </p>
              <p>
                This second effect only works against effects originating from the appropriate alignment.

              <p>
                Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm effects and compulsion effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person).
              </p>
              <p>
                The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast.
              </p>
              <p>
                This second effect only works against effects originating from the appropriate alignment.

                Pyrotechnics turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version you choose.

              <p>
                This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become <a href="#blinded">blinded</a> for 1d4+1 rounds (Fortitude negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected.

This allows you to understand the spells of other wizards from their spellbooks, to understand what is on a scroll, and other magical writings. Note to understand what these are you have to read them, which may trigger a curse or explosion.

                Once you have read and understood the magical inscription, you do not need the benefit of this spell to do so again for that magical inscription.

                This spell causes instant shrinkage of a humanoid creature, halving its height and multiplying its weight by 1/8. This decrease changes the creature’s size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC due to its decreased size.
              </p>
              <p>
                This spell does not change the target’s speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly shrunk by the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Melee weapons affected by this spell deal less damage (see <a href="#weapon-size">Weapon Size</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Other magical properties are not affected by this spell.

              <p>
                Any reduced item that leaves a reduced creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Magical properties of reduced items are not increased by this spell.

              <p>
                This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
              </p>
              <p>
                The subject gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature’s hit points.

                The spell protects the recipient’s equipment as well.

                Resist energy absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.

                When cast, a secret page spell alters the actual contents of a page so that they appear to be something entirely different. Thus, a map can be changed to become a treatise on burnishing ebony walking sticks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The text of a spell can be altered to show a ledger page or even another form of spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Confuse languages and explosive runes spells may be cast upon the secret page, but a comprehend languages spell cannot reveal the secret page's contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The caster is able to reveal the original contents by speaking a command word, perusing the actual page, and then returning it to its secret page form.
              </p>
              <p>
                The caster can also remove the spell by double repetition of the command word.
              </p>
              <p>
                A true seeing spell does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with a comprehend languages spell.

              <p>
                Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.

                The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

                When this spell is cast, a small written symbol appears in the text of any written work. When read, the so-called sepia snake springs into being and strikes at the nearest living creature (but does not attack the wizard who cast the spell).
              </p>
              <p>
                Its attack is made as if it were a monster with Hit Dice equal to the level of the wizard who cast the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                If it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed in a shimmering amber field of force, frozen and immobilized until released, either at the caster's command, by a successful dispel magic spell, or until a time equal to 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level has elapsed. Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of his surroundings.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in a flash of brown light, with a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one round.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and detect magic reveals only that the entire text is magical. A dispel magic can remove it. It can be cast in combination with other spells that hide or garble text.

              <p>
                You conjure a shadowy creature from the shadow realm, a realm that both exists and does not exist.
                You can change its appearance, but it must be generally that of a humanoid fighter-type.
              </p>
              <p>
                This creature fights like a warrior, but can only make normal attacks (no trip attacks, called shots, etc.).
                It cannot grapple creatures or be grappled. It must yield to overruns, but can defend against bull rush.
              </p>
              <p>
                The shadow warrior has whatever nonmagical arms and armor you want from the armor and weapons tables.
              </p>
              <p>
                The shadow warrior automatically makes saving throws.
              </p>
              <p>
                The shadow warrior cannot be healed.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Shadow Warrior obeys your commands. You can give it a new command as a move action. It will otherwise continue its last course of action (attacking a single target for example).
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to it not being real, it does not detonate traps and cannot pick up things.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can only hurt living things that believe that it is real. Thus it is ineffective against slimes, constructs, etc. Additionally, the victim of its attacks must believe that they would be hurt by the attack, which generally means only melee attacks will work.
              </p>
              <p>
                A creature with true sight can ignore the shadow warrior, but this does not end the spell.

                Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical objects (like glass); sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline creature.
              </p>
              <p>
                Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain. All such objects within a 5-foot radius of the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternatively, you can target shatter against a single nonmagical, solid object, regardless of composition, weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level. Held items get a saving throw rolled by their wielder.
              </p>
              <p>
                Targeted against a crystalline creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.

                Shield creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you.
              </p>
              <p>
                It negates magic missile attacks directed at you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk also provides a +2 shield bonus to AC against melee attacks and a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks. Note that the shield bonus does not stack with normal shields.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you do not actually hold the shield, it imposes no skill penalty.

                These benefits are only active when the weapon is wielded by you and are suppressed when you are not using it.

                You are able to shrink one nonmagical item (if it is within the size limit) to 1/16 of its normal size in each dimension (to about 1/4,000 the original volume and mass).
              </p>
              <p>
                This change effectively reduces the object’s size by four categories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Objects changed by a shrink item spell can be returned to normal composition and size merely by tossing them onto any solid surface or by a word of command from the original caster.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even a burning fire and its fuel can be shrunk by this spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Restoring the shrunken object to its normal size and composition ends the spell.

                Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells with verbal components cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell can be cast on a point in space, but the effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object.
              </p>
              <p>
                The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Items in a creature’s possession or magic items that emit sound receive the benefits of saves and spell resistance, but unattended objects and points in space do not.

                This spell creates the visual illusion of an object, creature, or force, as visualized by you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The illusion does not create sound, smell, texture, or temperature.

              <p>
                You can move the image within the limits of the size of the effect.

              <p>
                If you create the illusion of a creature, it has AC 10 and a succesful hit dispells it.

              <p>
                A sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).
              </p>
              <p>
                Sleep does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the duration ends, the creatures continue sleeping naturally, but may wake up due to normal noise or other normal ways of waking a creature.

                All creatures in the area must save or be slowed.

                You can comprehend and communicate with animals. You are able to ask questions of and receive answers from animals, although the spell doesn’t make them any more friendly or cooperative than normal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.

                A spider climb spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as well as a giant spider, or even hang upside down from ceilings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in this manner, at a movement rate of 20'.  The creature must use their hands and feet to move along the surface. The creature will likely need to remove their boots before this spell is cast.
              </p>
              <p>
                During the course of the spell, the recipient cannot handle objects that weigh less than a dagger, for such objects stick to his hands and feet.
                Thus, a spellcaster will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a spider climb spell (only those without somatic or material components).

                A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn.
              </p>
              <p>
                It uses your base attack bonus plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round’s target.
              </p>
              <p>
                On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack.
              </p>
              <p>
                A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks.

              <p>
                The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

              <p>
                You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

                The living toad becomes a bomb. After casting this spell you drop the toad onto a space adjacent to you. The toad cannot be hurled as that would cause it to detonate.
              </p>
              <p>
                The toad hops at a speed of 5' round as you direct it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can detonate the toad as a swift action. The toad also detonates if any creature touches it, it takes any damage, it enters a creatures space or a creature enters its space.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the toad detonates it deals 1d10 fire damage/level (max 3d10) in a 15x15 square centered on the toad. Creatures in the area can make a reflex save for half damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the spell expires, the toad explodes.

                By means of this spell, the caster is able to assume the form of a small living tree or shrub or that of a large dead tree trunk with only a few limbs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although the closest inspection cannot reveal that this plant is actually a person, and for all normal tests he is, in fact, a tree or shrub, the caster is able to observe all that goes on around him just as if he were in normal form.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Armor Class and hit points of the plant are those of the caster.
              </p>
              <p>
                The caster can remove the spell at any time, instantly changing from plant to his normal form and having full capability for any action normally possible (including spellcasting).
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that all clothing and gear worn or carried change with the caster.

              <p>
                An unseen servant is conjured into an area 30' in radius. Choose a spot when you cast this spell to be the center of this circle. The unseen servant cannot leave this area.
              </p>
              <p>
                An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. (Doors in dungeons are stuck by default).
              </p>
              <p>
                The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2.
              </p>
              <p>
                It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can’t be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell’s area, the servant ceases to exist.

                When you cast this spell you can deliver the spell as a melee <a href="#touch-attacks">touch attack</a> this round as a free action. If you miss, you can try again next round or until 10 minutes pass.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you hit with the touch attack, it deals 1d6 damage per two caster levels and you gain that many hit points. If this would put you over your maximum HP, the extra hit points are instead turned into temporary hit points that last for 1 hour per level. You can't steal more life force than the crature has hit points.

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points--floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc.--or the web collapses upon itself and disappears.

              <p>
                Webs are only effective against creatures of medium size or smaller.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is <a href="#entangled">entangled</a>, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below).
              </p>
              <p>
                If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 15 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature is not entangled, but can only move 5' per round through the web (or double that by hustling).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. Additionally, missile fire into or through a web is generally ineffective as it gets caught in the sticky strands.
              </p>
              <p>
                The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burns away the entire web in a flash.  All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

              <p>
                You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location.
              </p>
              <p>
                A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.

                A black bear grants you the following benefits.  You use your ranks in skills, your base save bonuses, and your base attack bonus.

              <p>
                You can transform back to your normal form as a standard action. While you are in your normal form, you can transform back to being a black bear as a swift action.

                You conjure a sudden, sharp blast of air that hurts those within. Those in the area suffer 1d6 slashing damage per caster level.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, it has the following effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4×10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet. If flying, a Tiny or smaller creature is blown back 2d6×10 feet and takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind, or if flying are blown back 1d6×10 feet.
              </p>
              <p>
                The force of the gale automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to the effects noted, a wind gale can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

                Tiny and Small flying creatures cannot pass through the barrier. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall suffer a -4 penalty.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sling stones and firearms suffer a -4 penalty.

                (A giant-thrown boulder, a cannonball, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.)

              <p>
                Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in any continuous path along the ground that you like. It is possible to create cylindrical or square wind walls to enclose specific points.

                A wizard lock spell cast upon a door, chest, or portal magically locks it. The caster can freely pass his own lock without affecting it; otherwise, the wizard-locked door or object can be opened only by breaking in, by a successful dispel magic or knock spell, or by a wizard four or more levels higher than the one casting the spell.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that the last two methods do not remove the wizard lock; they only negate it for a brief duration--about one turn.
              </p>
              <p>
                Creatures from other planes cannot burst a wizard lock as they can a held portal (see the hold portal spell).

                This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible.
              </p>
              <p>
                A wizard mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If an invisible mark is made, a detect magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.
              </p>
              <p>
                See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise allows the user to see an invisible wizard mark. A read magic spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a wizard mark is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

            <p>
              If ships both wish to fight, there is no need for a grapple check.
            </p>
            <p>
              If one ship wishes to fight, the aggressors can roll 1 grapple attempt.
            </p>
            <p>
              This attempt is a DC 15 Sailing check (BAB+str may be substituted for this check).
              If the ships are traveling opposite directions, then the DC is 20 instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              A successful grapple check leads directly to a general melee onboard.

              <p>
                The players will declare if they wish to rush onboard and fight on their ship or defend their ship. The DM will secretly decide if the other ship will attack or defend.
                If both attack, which ship is the battlefield is randomly determined and there is no defender advantage.
                If one side attacks and the other defends, the battle is on the defender’s ship and the defender gains a +2 bonus for that turn only.
              </p>
              <p>
                If both defends, there is no melee that round and the grapples may be cut.
                The boarding ends at that point (but can be restarted the next round if the pilot is able to keep the ships abreast).
              </p>
              <p>
                The battle ends with the defeat or surrender of the captain. To reach the enemy captain, you must advance through the decks. Some captains may surrender early if they believe themselves greatly overpowered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ships have a different number of decks depending on the size of the ship.

                  To calculate the strength of the crew, add up their hit dice, including the officers (raw recruits have 1/2 hit die). Normal sailors have 1 hit die. Men who are poorly outfitted fight at half effectiveness (so a raw recruit with a club fights at 1/4 effectiveness). Exceptionally well armed crews fight at a higher bonus as determined by the dm (for example if all their swords are +1, then they fight with an extra hit die per man).
                </p>
                <p>
                  To calculate the damage dice done by the crew, divide their strength by 6. This number is used for inflicting casualties.

              <p>
                Each round, both sides get a chance to attack. First one side rolls a d20+ their bonus against 10+enemy bonus. If they “hit”, they roll a d6 for each of their damage dice (calculated above). Casualties are subtracted and the ratios recalculated at the end of each round.
              </p>
              <p>
                Casualties are subtracted from that sides effective hit dice. Keep track of when only the hit dice of the officers remain. If this happens to the PCs, they can either surrender or we switch to man to man, but they have to fight the entire remaining enemy crew in a massive melee clusterfuck. If it happens to the NPCs, then something something.
              </p>
              <p>
                If both sides hit or neither side hits, that round is a draw. If this was the first round of the boarding, crews met briefly and repulse back to respective vessels. 33% chance the grapple is immediately severed (if that side wants to).
              </p>
              <p>
                If only one side hits, then the side that hits advances one area.
              </p>
              <p>
                If one side is ever driven back to their ship, the grapple lines are cut.
              </p>
              <p>
                After every movement, check to see if the captain is reached. When the captain is reached, each side rolls to hit one more time, but only for the purpose of inflicting casualties. Regardless of the result, we immediately switch to resolving the captain showdown.

              <p>
                When the captain is reached, he can either surrender or commit to battle. At this point each ships captains + officers will have a man-to-man battle. The side with fewer people in this battle will fill in with crewmen until the numbers are balanced (or they run out of crewmen).
              </p>
              <p>
                This battle is then resolved in the usual manner. NPCs dropped due to negative hit points are 33% to survive, but be dying and needing medical attention to survive (the DM is too lazy to track negative NPC HPs).
              </p>
              <p>
                If the party is defeated, any who did not fall to negative 10 (and thus die outright) will almost certainly be ransomed (unless they have no reputation or money, in which case they will be given to the sharks).

                Casualties should be distributed as evenly as possible. After as many whole number casualties are inflicted as possible, determine randomly. Determine casualties after everything is resolved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Roll on the following table to determine casualty distribution. Note that casualties are counted in hit dice. Thus if you rolled a 1 on the below table (1/3rd to each category) and had suffered 6 hit dice of casualties, you have 2 hit dice dead, 2 hit dice wounded, 2 hit dice fled.
